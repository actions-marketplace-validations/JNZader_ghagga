# Quick Start

## Choose Your Path

| If you want... | Use | Time | Requires | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Easiest setup — install and go** | **SaaS (GitHub App)** ⭐ Recommended | ~5 min | GitHub account | [SaaS Guide](saas-getting-started.md) |
| CI/CD integration — runs in your pipeline | GitHub Action | ~10 min | Repo admin access | [Action Guide](github-action.md) |
| Local review from your terminal | CLI | ~5 min | Node.js 22+ | [CLI Guide](cli.md) |
| Full control — your own server | Self-Hosted (Docker) | ~30 min | Docker, PostgreSQL | [Self-Hosted Guide](self-hosted.md) |

All modes use the same review engine under the hood. [Learn more about the architecture](architecture.md).

## GitHub Action (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started. No server needed — runs directly in GitHub's infrastructure.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/review.yml
name: Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: JNZader/ghagga@v2
```

See [GitHub Action](github-action.md) for all inputs and outputs.

## CLI

Review local changes from your terminal. No server required.

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g ghagga

# Login with GitHub (free — uses GitHub Models, no API key needed)
ghagga login

# Review staged changes (default: simple mode, GitHub Models (free))
ghagga review

# Review with options
ghagga review --mode workflow --format json
```

See [CLI](cli.md) for all options and config file support.

## Self-Hosted (Docker)

Full deployment with PostgreSQL, memory, and dashboard support.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JNZader/ghagga.git
cd ghagga
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL 16 on port 5432 and the GHAGGA Server (Hono) on port 3000 with Semgrep, Trivy, and CPD pre-installed.

See [Self-Hosted](self-hosted.md) for full deployment details.

## SaaS Mode — Runner Setup

If you're using the hosted GHAGGA SaaS (Render deployment), static analysis runs on a delegated runner.

> **Important**: After installing the GitHub App, you must configure an LLM provider in the [Dashboard](https://jnzader.github.io/ghagga/app/) before reviews will work. See the [SaaS Getting Started Guide](saas-getting-started.md) for the full setup flow.

To enable static analysis:

1. **[Open the Dashboard](https://jnzader.github.io/ghagga/app/)** and go to **Global Settings**
2. **Click "Enable Runner"** in the Static Analysis Runner card
3. A public repository named `ghagga-runner` will be created in your GitHub account from the official template

If your account was created before the `public_repo` scope was added, you'll be prompted to re-authenticate. This is a one-time step.

That's it. The server will auto-discover your runner and dispatch static analysis to it. If you skip this step, reviews still work — they just skip static analysis.

See [Runner Architecture](runner-architecture.md) for details.

## BYOK — Bring Your Own Key

> **Free by default**: GHAGGA is free and open source. GitHub Models provides free LLM access (`gpt-4o-mini`) — no API key needed. The providers below are optional if you want different models.

GHAGGA never sees or stores your keys in plaintext. They're encrypted with AES-256-GCM at rest. You bring your own API key from any supported provider:

| Provider | Default Model |
|----------|--------------|
| GitHub Models | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| Anthropic | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| OpenAI | `gpt-4o` |
| Google | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| Ollama | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` |
| Qwen | `qwen-coder-plus` |

Static analysis tools (Semgrep, Trivy, CPD) are always free — they run on GitHub Actions runners (unlimited free minutes for public repos).
