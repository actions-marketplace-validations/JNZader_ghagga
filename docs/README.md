# GHAGGA

> **AI-Powered Multi-Agent Code Review**

GHAGGA is a code review tool that posts intelligent comments on your Pull Requests. It combines LLM analysis with up to 15 static analysis tools and a project memory system that learns across reviews.

| I just want to explore | Keep reading below, then check [Quick Start](quick-start.md) |

## How It Works

1. **Receives** a PR diff (via webhook, CLI, or GitHub Action)
2. **Scans** it with static analysis tools — zero LLM tokens for known issues
3. **Searches** project memory for past decisions, patterns, and bug fixes
4. **Sends** the diff + static findings + memory to AI agents
5. **Posts** a structured review comment with findings, severity, and suggestions
6. **Learns** by extracting observations and storing them for next time

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **3 Review Modes** | Simple (single LLM), Workflow (5 specialist agents), Consensus (multi-model voting) |
| **15 Static Analysis Tools** | Semgrep, Trivy, CPD, Gitleaks, ShellCheck, markdownlint, Lizard + 8 auto-detect tools — zero tokens |
| **Delegated Runner** | Static analysis runs on user-owned GitHub Actions runners (7GB RAM, free for public repos) |
| **Project Memory** | Learns patterns, decisions, and bug fixes across reviews (PostgreSQL + tsvector FTS for Server / SQLite + FTS5 for CLI & Action) |
| **Multi-Provider** | 6 providers: GitHub Models (free), Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama (local), Qwen (Alibaba) — bring your own key |
| **3 Distribution Modes** | SaaS, GitHub Action, CLI |
| **Comment Trigger** | Type `ghagga review` on any PR to re-trigger a review on demand |
| **Dashboard** | React SPA on GitHub Pages — review history, stats, settings, memory browser |
| **BYOK Security** | AES-256-GCM encryption, HMAC-SHA256 webhook verification, privacy stripping |

## Architecture at a Glance

  end

  RunnerRepo -- "callback" --> Server
  Server --> Core

  CLI --> Core
```

The review engine (`@ghagga/core`) is distribution-agnostic. Each app is a thin adapter that feeds diffs into the core and handles I/O.

## Origins

GHAGGA is a complete rewrite of [Gentleman Guardian Angel (GGA)](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentleman-guardian-angel) by [Gentleman Programming](https://youtube.com/@GentlemanProgramming). Memory system design patterns inspired by [Engram](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram).
