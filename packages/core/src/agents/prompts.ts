Your task:
1. Combine all findings into a unified report
2. Remove duplicate issues mentioned by multiple reviewers
3. Prioritize by severity: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
4. Determine final status

Format your response EXACTLY as:

STATUS: [PASSED or FAILED]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence overview]
FINDINGS:
