# Tooling Specification

> **Origin**: Archived from `biome-linting` change, domain `tooling` (2026-03-07)

## Purpose

Development tooling for the GHAGGA monorepo: linting, formatting, and CI quality gates that enforce code consistency and catch issues before review.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Biome Configuration

The project MUST have a `biome.json` configuration file at the repository root that applies to all workspace packages and apps.

The configuration MUST enable Biome's `recommended` linter ruleset.

The following rules MUST be set to `warn` severity (not `error`):
- `noUnusedVariables`
- `noUnusedImports`
- `noExplicitAny`

The formatter MUST be configured with:
- 2-space indentation
- 100-character line width
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons always required

The configuration MUST ignore the following directories:
- `node_modules`
- `dist`
- `coverage`
- `.turbo`
- `.next`

The configuration MUST apply to `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, and `.json` files.

#### Scenario: Biome config exists and is valid

- GIVEN the repository has been set up with Biome
- WHEN a developer runs `npx @biomejs/biome check biome.json`
- THEN the command MUST succeed without configuration errors

#### Scenario: Lint rules apply to TypeScript files

- GIVEN a `.ts` file in `packages/core/src/` contains an unused import
- WHEN the developer runs `pnpm lint`
- THEN Biome MUST report a warning for `noUnusedImports` on that file
- AND the exit code MUST be 0 (warnings don't fail the check)

#### Scenario: Lint rules apply to React TSX files

- GIVEN a `.tsx` file in `apps/dashboard/src/` contains an unused variable
- WHEN the developer runs `pnpm lint`
- THEN Biome MUST report a warning for `noUnusedVariables` on that file

#### Scenario: Ignored directories are not checked

- GIVEN files exist in `packages/core/dist/` and `node_modules/`
- WHEN the developer runs `pnpm lint`
- THEN Biome MUST NOT report any diagnostics for files in those directories

#### Scenario: Formatter enforces configured style

- GIVEN a `.ts` file uses double quotes, 4-space indentation, and lines exceeding 100 characters
- WHEN the developer runs `pnpm lint`
- THEN Biome MUST report formatting diagnostics for quote style, indentation, and line width

---

### Requirement: Monorepo Lint Scripts

The root `package.json` MUST include a `lint` script that runs Biome's `check` command across the entire workspace.

The root `package.json` MUST include a `lint:fix` script that runs Biome's `check --write` command to auto-fix formatting and auto-fixable lint issues.

The `lint` script MUST exit with a non-zero exit code when lint errors are present.

The `lint` script MUST exit with code 0 when only warnings are present (no errors).

#### Scenario: Lint command works on clean codebase

- GIVEN the codebase has been cleaned up and passes all lint checks
- WHEN the developer runs `pnpm lint`
- THEN the command MUST exit with code 0
- AND the output MUST indicate no errors found

#### Scenario: Lint:fix auto-fixes formatting issues

- GIVEN a file has incorrect formatting (e.g., double quotes instead of single quotes)
- WHEN the developer runs `pnpm lint:fix`
- THEN the file MUST be modified in place with correct formatting
- AND the command MUST exit with code 0

#### Scenario: Lint exits non-zero on errors

- GIVEN a file contains a lint error (not a warning)
- WHEN the developer runs `pnpm lint`
- THEN the command MUST exit with a non-zero exit code
- AND the output MUST list the error with file path and line number

---

### Requirement: CI Lint Integration

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) MUST include a lint step that runs `pnpm lint`.

The lint step MUST run BEFORE the test step in the pipeline so that style issues are caught early (fail-fast).

The lint step MUST NOT depend on the `build` task (Biome works on source files directly).

A lint failure MUST block the PR from merging (same as typecheck and test failures).

#### Scenario: CI includes lint step

- GIVEN a pull request is opened against `main`
- WHEN the CI pipeline runs
- THEN a lint job MUST execute `pnpm lint`
- AND the lint job MUST complete before the test job starts

#### Scenario: Lint failure blocks merge

- GIVEN a pull request introduces a file with lint errors
- WHEN the CI pipeline runs
- THEN the lint job MUST fail
- AND the overall CI status MUST be "failed"
- AND the PR MUST NOT be mergeable (if branch protection is enabled)

#### Scenario: Lint passes on clean code

- GIVEN a pull request with properly formatted and lint-clean code
- WHEN the CI pipeline runs
- THEN the lint job MUST pass
- AND the pipeline MUST proceed to the test step

---

### Requirement: Clean Codebase

After the initial setup and cleanup, the entire codebase MUST pass `pnpm lint` with exit code 0.

All auto-fixable issues MUST be resolved by running `pnpm lint:fix`.

Any remaining issues that cannot be auto-fixed MUST be manually resolved or suppressed with inline `biome-ignore` comments (with justification).

#### Scenario: Full lint passes on current codebase

- GIVEN the Biome setup and initial cleanup have been completed
- WHEN the developer runs `pnpm lint`
- THEN the command MUST exit with code 0
- AND no lint errors MUST be reported (warnings are acceptable)

#### Scenario: No biome-ignore comments without justification

- GIVEN the codebase contains `biome-ignore` suppression comments
- WHEN reviewing the comments
- THEN each comment MUST include a justification explaining why the rule is suppressed
- AND the format MUST be `// biome-ignore <rule>: <reason>`

---

### Requirement: Logger Instead of console.error in OAuth Route

The `console.error` calls in `apps/server/src/routes/oauth.ts` MUST be replaced with the project's `pino` logger.

The logger instance MUST use a child logger with `{ module: 'oauth' }` context for traceability.

The log level MUST be `error` for error conditions (matching the original `console.error` intent).

#### Scenario: No console.error in oauth.ts

- GIVEN the oauth.ts file has been updated
- WHEN searching for `console.error` in `apps/server/src/routes/oauth.ts`
- THEN zero occurrences MUST be found

#### Scenario: Errors logged with structured logger

- GIVEN an OAuth callback fails (e.g., token exchange error)
- WHEN the error handler executes
- THEN the error MUST be logged via `pino` logger with level `error`
- AND the log entry MUST include the `module: 'oauth'` context

---

### Requirement: OAuth Client ID from Environment Variable

The GitHub OAuth Client ID in the server MUST be read from the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.

The GitHub OAuth Client ID in the dashboard MUST be read from the `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable (Vite convention for client-exposed env vars).

Both MUST fall back to the current hardcoded value if the environment variable is not set, ensuring backward compatibility.

#### Scenario: Server reads Client ID from env

- GIVEN the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is set to `test-client-id`
- WHEN the OAuth flow initiates in the server
- THEN the OAuth authorization URL MUST use `client_id=test-client-id`

#### Scenario: Server falls back to hardcoded Client ID

- GIVEN the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is NOT set
- WHEN the OAuth flow initiates in the server
- THEN the OAuth authorization URL MUST use the current hardcoded Client ID value

#### Scenario: Dashboard reads Client ID from env

- GIVEN the `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is set at build time
- WHEN the dashboard renders the GitHub login button
- THEN the OAuth URL MUST use the value from `import.meta.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`

#### Scenario: Dashboard falls back to hardcoded Client ID

- GIVEN the `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is NOT set at build time
- WHEN the dashboard renders the GitHub login button
- THEN the OAuth URL MUST use the current hardcoded Client ID value as fallback

---

### Requirement: CI Security Scanning

> **Origin**: Archived from `ci-hardening` change (2026-03-07)

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) MUST include a `security` job that runs on every push and PR to main.

The `security` job MUST run `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high` to flag high and critical dependency vulnerabilities.

The `security` job MUST use `continue-on-error: true` — it warns but does not block CI.

The `security` job MUST run in parallel with existing `check` and `lint` jobs (no dependencies).

#### Scenario: PR triggers security scanning

- GIVEN a pull request is opened against `main`
- WHEN the CI pipeline runs
- THEN the `security` job MUST execute `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high`
- AND the job MUST NOT block other jobs from running

#### Scenario: pnpm audit finds high vulnerability

- GIVEN a dependency has a known high-severity vulnerability
- WHEN the `security` job runs
- THEN the vulnerability MUST be reported in the job logs
- AND CI MUST continue (not fail) due to `continue-on-error: true`

#### Scenario: pnpm audit network error

- GIVEN the npm registry is unreachable during CI
- WHEN the `security` job attempts to run `pnpm audit`
- THEN `continue-on-error` MUST prevent CI failure

---

### Requirement: CI Coverage Reporting

> **Origin**: Archived from `ci-hardening` change (2026-03-07)

The existing CI `test` job MUST run `pnpm exec turbo test:coverage` instead of `pnpm exec turbo test`.

All workspace packages already define `test:coverage` scripts — no `package.json` changes are needed.

Coverage output directories MUST be uploaded as CI artifacts with 7-day retention.

No external coverage services are required (no Codecov, no SonarCloud).

#### Scenario: Test job generates coverage

- GIVEN a push or PR triggers CI
- WHEN the `test` job runs
- THEN it MUST execute `pnpm exec turbo test:coverage`
- AND coverage artifacts MUST be uploaded with 7-day retention

#### Scenario: No coverage data generated

- GIVEN a workspace package has no tests or produces no coverage output
- WHEN the artifact upload step runs
- THEN `if-no-files-found: ignore` MUST prevent the step from failing

---

### Requirement: CI Mutation Testing

> **Origin**: Archived from `ci-hardening` change (2026-03-07)

The CI workflow MUST include a `mutation` job that runs **only** on pushes to main (`github.event_name == 'push'`).

The `mutation` job MUST depend on the test job: `needs: [test]`.

The `mutation` job MUST run Stryker only on `packages/core` (the most critical code).

The `mutation` job MUST have a `timeout-minutes: 30` limit.

The `mutation` job MUST use `continue-on-error: true` — mutation score is informational.

The mutation report MUST be uploaded as a CI artifact.

#### Scenario: Push to main triggers mutation testing

- GIVEN a push to `main` triggers CI
- WHEN the `test` job completes successfully
- THEN the `mutation` job MUST run Stryker on `packages/core`
- AND the mutation report MUST be uploaded as an artifact

#### Scenario: PR does not trigger mutation testing

- GIVEN a pull request is opened against `main`
- WHEN the CI pipeline runs
- THEN the `mutation` job MUST NOT run

#### Scenario: Stryker exceeds timeout

- GIVEN the mutation job is running Stryker
- WHEN the job exceeds 30 minutes
- THEN the job MUST be killed at the timeout limit
- AND CI MUST continue (not fail)
