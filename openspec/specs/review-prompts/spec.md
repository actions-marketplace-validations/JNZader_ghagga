## Requirements

### Requirement: Memory Context Retrieval Limit

The system MUST retrieve at most **3** observations when searching past review memory for prompt context.

#### Scenario: Memory search returns observations within the new limit

- GIVEN a project with 10 past review observations in the database
- WHEN `searchMemoryForContext()` is called for a new review
- THEN at most 3 observations are returned
- AND the 3 observations are the highest-ranked matches for the current file paths

#### Scenario: Memory search with fewer observations than the limit

- GIVEN a project with 2 past review observations in the database
- WHEN `searchMemoryForContext()` is called for a new review
- THEN all 2 observations are returned (no padding or synthetic observations)

#### Scenario: Memory search with no observations

- GIVEN a project with zero past review observations in the database
- WHEN `searchMemoryForContext()` is called for a new review
- THEN `null` is returned
- AND the review pipeline continues without memory context

---

### Requirement: Memory Context Framing in Prompts

The system MUST frame injected memory observations as **passive background context** that SHALL NOT be used as justification for flagging issues. The `buildMemoryContext()` function MUST include explicit instructions that observations are for situational awareness only and that findings MUST be justified solely from the code diff.

The `buildMemoryContext()` function MUST NOT include any directive that encourages the LLM to actively use past observations as a basis for current findings (e.g., "Use these past observations to give more informed, context-aware reviews"). Memory should inform, not drive, the review.

#### Scenario: Memory context is injected with anti-priming instructions

- GIVEN a review with non-null memory context containing 2 past observations
- WHEN `buildMemoryContext()` formats the memory for prompt injection
- THEN the output MUST contain an instruction stating the observations are "background context" or "situational awareness only"
- AND the output MUST contain an explicit prohibition: "Do NOT use them as reasons to flag issues" or equivalent phrasing
- AND the output MUST contain a directive that findings must be justified "from the code diff itself" or equivalent phrasing

#### Scenario: Memory context is null

- GIVEN a review with null memory context (memory disabled, no DB, or no matches)
- WHEN `buildMemoryContext(null)` is called
- THEN an empty string is returned
- AND no memory-related instructions appear in the system prompt

#### Scenario: Memory context does not dominate the prompt

- GIVEN a review where the diff is under 500 tokens
- WHEN memory context is injected into the system prompt
- THEN the memory context section SHOULD NOT exceed the size of the diff section
- AND the memory framing instructions remain present regardless of diff size

#### Scenario: Old priming language is absent

- GIVEN a review with non-null memory context
- WHEN `buildMemoryContext()` formats the output
- THEN the output MUST NOT contain "give more informed" or "context-aware reviews"
- AND the output MUST NOT contain any imperative to "use" the observations for review decisions

---

### Requirement: Review Level Prompt Calibration

The system MUST inject review-level-specific calibration instructions into the system prompt for **all three review modes** (simple, workflow, consensus) based on the `reviewLevel` field from `ReviewSettings`.

A function `buildReviewLevelInstruction(level: ReviewLevel)` MUST exist in `prompts.ts` that returns level-appropriate instructions.

#### Scenario: Soft review level — bugs and security only

- GIVEN a review with `reviewLevel` set to `'soft'`
- WHEN the system prompt is assembled for any review mode
- THEN the prompt MUST include an instruction requiring **90%+ confidence** before flagging
- AND the prompt MUST instruct the reviewer to focus **exclusively** on bugs, security vulnerabilities, and logic errors
- AND the prompt MUST instruct the reviewer to **ignore** style, naming, and maintainability concerns

#### Scenario: Normal review level — balanced with caution on style

- GIVEN a review with `reviewLevel` set to `'normal'`
- WHEN the system prompt is assembled for any review mode
- THEN the prompt MUST include an instruction requiring **80%+ confidence** before flagging
- AND the prompt MUST instruct the reviewer to cover bugs, security, performance, and error handling
- AND the prompt MUST instruct the reviewer to be **cautious** with style-only findings

#### Scenario: Strict review level — thorough review

- GIVEN a review with `reviewLevel` set to `'strict'`
- WHEN the system prompt is assembled for any review mode
- THEN the prompt MUST instruct the reviewer to perform a **thorough review** covering all categories
- AND the prompt MUST include style, naming, and documentation in the review scope
- AND the prompt MUST instruct the reviewer to flag anything that could be improved

#### Scenario: Default review level when not explicitly set

- GIVEN a review where `reviewLevel` is `'normal'` (the default from `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`)
- WHEN the system prompt is assembled
- THEN the `'normal'` calibration instructions are injected
- AND no error or fallback occurs

#### Scenario: Review level flows through simple mode

- GIVEN a review in `'simple'` mode with `reviewLevel` set to `'soft'`
- WHEN `runSimpleReview()` assembles the system prompt
- THEN the soft-level calibration instructions appear in the system prompt sent to the LLM

#### Scenario: Review level flows through workflow mode

- GIVEN a review in `'workflow'` mode with `reviewLevel` set to `'soft'`
- WHEN `runWorkflowReview()` assembles the system prompt for each specialist
- THEN the soft-level calibration instructions appear in **every** specialist's system prompt
- AND the calibration instructions also appear in the synthesis prompt

#### Scenario: Review level flows through consensus mode

- GIVEN a review in `'consensus'` mode with `reviewLevel` set to `'strict'`
- WHEN `runConsensusReview()` assembles the system prompt for each model vote
- THEN the strict-level calibration instructions appear in **every** stance prompt (for, against, neutral)

---

### Requirement: Review Level Plumbing Through Agent Inputs

The `SimpleReviewInput`, `WorkflowReviewInput`, and `ConsensusReviewInput` interfaces MUST accept a `reviewLevel` field. The pipeline MUST pass `settings.reviewLevel` from `ReviewInput` into each agent's input type.

#### Scenario: Pipeline passes reviewLevel to simple agent

- GIVEN a `ReviewInput` with `settings.reviewLevel` set to `'soft'`
- WHEN the pipeline dispatches to `runSimpleReview()`
- THEN the `SimpleReviewInput` includes `reviewLevel: 'soft'`

#### Scenario: Pipeline passes reviewLevel to workflow agent

- GIVEN a `ReviewInput` with `settings.reviewLevel` set to `'strict'`
- WHEN the pipeline dispatches to `runWorkflowReview()`
- THEN the `WorkflowReviewInput` includes `reviewLevel: 'strict'`

#### Scenario: Pipeline passes reviewLevel to consensus agent

- GIVEN a `ReviewInput` with `settings.reviewLevel` set to `'normal'`
- WHEN the pipeline dispatches to `runConsensusReview()`
- THEN the `ConsensusReviewInput` includes `reviewLevel: 'normal'`

---

### Requirement: Anti-False-Positive Calibration Block

The system MUST append a `REVIEW_CALIBRATION` constant to the system prompts of **all** review modes. This calibration block MUST contain the following anti-hallucination guardrails:

1. A confidence threshold instruction: only report findings with 80%+ confidence based on the actual code shown.
2. A prohibition against flagging stylistic preferences unless they violate an explicitly provided rule.
3. A prohibition against inventing or assuming coding standards that are not provided.
4. A prohibition against flagging hypothetical edge cases that are unlikely in practice.
5. An explicit permission to return `STATUS: PASSED` with zero findings when the diff is small and clean.

#### Scenario: Calibration block appears in simple mode prompt

- GIVEN a review in `'simple'` mode
- WHEN the system prompt is assembled
- THEN the `REVIEW_CALIBRATION` text appears in the system prompt
- AND it appears after the main review instructions (not before)

#### Scenario: Calibration block appears in workflow specialist prompts

- GIVEN a review in `'workflow'` mode
- WHEN each specialist's system prompt is assembled
- THEN the `REVIEW_CALIBRATION` text appears in each of the 5 specialist system prompts

#### Scenario: Calibration block appears in consensus stance prompts

- GIVEN a review in `'consensus'` mode
- WHEN each stance's system prompt is assembled
- THEN the `REVIEW_CALIBRATION` text appears in all 3 stance prompts (for, against, neutral)

#### Scenario: Calibration block prohibits inventing standards

- GIVEN a review where `customRules` is empty (no repository-specific rules provided)
- WHEN the LLM evaluates the diff
- THEN the system prompt MUST NOT contain any instruction to "check adherence to coding standards"
- AND the calibration block MUST contain a prohibition against inventing or assuming coding standards

#### Scenario: Calibration block permits PASSED on clean diffs

- GIVEN a review of a small, clean diff (e.g., a 10-line variable rename)
- WHEN the LLM evaluates the diff
- THEN the system prompt MUST contain an instruction that returning `STATUS: PASSED` with zero findings is acceptable
- AND the LLM is not pressured to produce findings where none exist

#### Scenario: Calibration interacts with review level

- GIVEN a review with `reviewLevel: 'soft'` and the `REVIEW_CALIBRATION` block
- WHEN the system prompt is assembled
- THEN BOTH the soft-level instruction (90%+ confidence) AND the calibration block (80%+ confidence) appear in the prompt
- AND the more restrictive threshold (90% from soft level) takes effective precedence

---

### Requirement: Simple Review System Prompt Content

The `SIMPLE_REVIEW_SYSTEM` constant MUST NOT contain the instruction "Check adherence to the repository's coding standards and rules" or equivalent phrasing. The constant MUST contain 5 review instruction items covering: bugs, error handling, code quality, security, and performance.

#### Scenario: System prompt no longer references unprovidable standards

- GIVEN the `SIMPLE_REVIEW_SYSTEM` constant
- WHEN it is read as a string
- THEN it MUST NOT contain the phrase "coding standards and rules" or equivalent
- AND it MUST contain the remaining 5 review instruction items (bugs, error handling, code quality, security, performance)

#### Scenario: Custom rules are still respected when provided

- GIVEN a review where `customRules` contains `["no-console-log", "max-function-length-50"]`
- WHEN the system prompt is assembled
- THEN the custom rules MAY be injected separately (outside `SIMPLE_REVIEW_SYSTEM`)
- AND the calibration block's prohibition against inventing standards does not conflict with explicitly provided rules

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Requirement: No Schema or API Changes

All prompt and memory changes MUST be confined to the prompt/memory layer within `packages/core`. There MUST be no database schema changes, no new npm dependencies, no API contract changes, and no modifications to the `ReviewResult` output shape.

#### Scenario: Types remain structurally unchanged

- GIVEN the `ReviewLevel` type in `types.ts`
- THEN the type definition `'soft' | 'normal' | 'strict'` MUST remain unchanged
- AND no new types are added to `types.ts` beyond what already exists

#### Scenario: Existing tests remain valid

- GIVEN the existing test suite in the repository
- WHEN prompt-layer changes are applied
- THEN all existing tests MUST pass without modification
- AND any test that asserts on prompt content MAY need updating only if it asserts on removed or modified prompt text

### Requirement: Cross-Provider Compatibility

The calibration instructions and review-level prompts MUST use universal, provider-agnostic language. They MUST NOT rely on provider-specific prompt engineering tricks (e.g., Anthropic XML tags, OpenAI system role hacks).

#### Scenario: Prompts work across all supported providers

- GIVEN the calibration and review-level instructions
- WHEN the same diff is reviewed using Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google providers
- THEN each provider SHOULD produce reviews that respect the calibration guardrails
- AND no provider-specific formatting is required in the injected instructions

### Requirement: Backward Compatibility of Pipeline Calls

The `reviewPipeline()` function signature and the `ReviewInput` type MUST NOT change. The `reviewLevel` field already exists on `ReviewSettings` and MUST be threaded internally without altering external contracts.

#### Scenario: CLI distribution mode is unaffected

- GIVEN a CLI invocation that does not set `reviewLevel` explicitly
- WHEN `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` provides `reviewLevel: 'normal'`
- THEN the review runs with normal-level calibration
- AND the CLI does not need any code changes

#### Scenario: SaaS distribution mode is unaffected

- GIVEN a SaaS review triggered via webhook
- WHEN `reviewLevel` is read from the repository's stored settings
- THEN the review runs with the configured level
- AND no server-side code changes are needed beyond what `packages/core` provides
