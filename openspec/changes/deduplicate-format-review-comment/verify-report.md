## Build & Tests Execution

**Build**: N/A (tests ran successfully which implies compilation; no separate `turbo build` executed — pre-existing setup)

**Tests**:

| Project | Tests | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| core | 467 passed, 0 failed | ✅ PASSED |
| server | 363 passed, 0 failed | ✅ PASSED |
| action | 185 passed, 0 failed | ✅ PASSED |
| **Total** | **1015 passed** | **✅ All green** |

```
Core:   22 test files, 467 tests passed (929ms)
Server:  9 test files, 363 tests passed (741ms)
Action:  8 test files, 185 tests passed (10.45s)
```

**Coverage**: Not configured (no `rules.verify.coverage_threshold` in openspec)

## Spec Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | Scenario | Test(s) | Result |
|-------------|----------|---------|--------|
| R1, R2, R4, R6 | **S1**: Happy path — findings from all sources | `format.test.ts > renders findings grouped by source in render order (semgrep → trivy → cpd → ai)` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| R2, R6 | **S2**: Empty findings | `format.test.ts > does not render findings table when there are no findings` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| R2, R6 | **S3**: Status variants (×4) | `format.test.ts > renders status %s as "%s"` (4 parametrized cases) | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| R2, R6 | **S4**: Pipe and newline escaping | `format.test.ts > escapes pipes and replaces newlines in finding messages` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| R2, R3 | **S5**: Server consumer — same output | `review.test.ts > inngest/review — formatReviewComment (via post-comment)` (2 integration tests) | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| R2, R3 | **S6**: Action consumer — same output | `index.test.ts` (24 tests pass, action uses import from ghagga-core at line 29) | ✅ COMPLIANT |

**Additional tests covering spec invariants:**

| Invariant / Edge Case | Test | Result |
|-----------------------|------|--------|
| Finding without `line` renders file only | `format.test.ts > renders file path without line number when line is undefined` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Finding with `line` renders `file:line` | `format.test.ts > renders file path with line number when line is present` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Static analysis: both `toolsRun` and `toolsSkipped` | `format.test.ts > renders both tools run and tools skipped` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Footer always present | `format.test.ts > always includes the footer` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Sources not present silently skipped | `format.test.ts > silently skips sources with no findings` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| All severity emojis rendered | `format.test.ts > renders severity emoji for each severity level` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Finding with no source defaults to `ai` | `format.test.ts > groups findings with no source under AI Review` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Constants: STATUS_EMOJI maps all 4 values | `format.test.ts > STATUS_EMOJI > maps all four ReviewStatus values` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Constants: SEVERITY_EMOJI maps all 5 levels | `format.test.ts > SEVERITY_EMOJI > maps all five severity levels` | ✅ COMPLIANT |

**Compliance summary**: 6/6 spec scenarios COMPLIANT + 9 additional invariant tests COMPLIANT

## Correctness (Static — Structural Evidence)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| R1: Single Source of Truth | ✅ Implemented | `formatReviewComment` exported from `packages/core/src/format.ts:29`, re-exported from `packages/core/src/index.ts:76` |
| R2: Behavioral Equivalence | ✅ Implemented | Function body is verbatim copy; S1–S4 unit tests pass; S5–S6 integration tests pass unchanged |
| R3: Consumer Migration (server) | ✅ Implemented | `apps/server/src/inngest/review.ts:24` imports from `ghagga-core`; no local definition |
| R3: Consumer Migration (action) | ✅ Implemented | `apps/action/src/index.ts:29` imports from `ghagga-core`; no local definition |
| R4: Constants Co-location | ✅ Implemented | `STATUS_EMOJI` exported at `format.ts:12`; `SEVERITY_EMOJI` exported at `format.ts:19`; `SOURCE_LABELS` and `renderOrder` are function-local at `format.ts:53-59` |
| R5: No Dead Code | ✅ Implemented | `grep` for `function formatReviewComment` in `apps/server/src` → 0 results; in `apps/action/src` → 0 results. `grep` for `STATUS_EMOJI`/`SEVERITY_EMOJI` definitions in `apps/server/src` → 0 results. Action test file has inline re-declarations for assertion (acceptable — these are test constants, not dead production code) |
| R6: Test Coverage | ✅ Implemented | `packages/core/src/format.test.ts` has 16 tests covering: grouped sources, empty findings, all 4 status variants, pipe/newline escaping, static analysis section, footer, severity emojis, missing line number, no-source fallback |
| CC1: Export Surface | ✅ Implemented | `packages/core/src/index.ts:74-76` exports `formatReviewComment`, `STATUS_EMOJI`, `SEVERITY_EMOJI` under `// ─── Formatting` section |
| CC2: Type Compatibility | ✅ Implemented | `format.ts:8` imports only `ReviewResult` and `ReviewStatus` from `./types.js` — types already in ghagga-core |

## Coherence (Design)

Design was intentionally skipped for this change (pure extraction refactor). No design.md exists.

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Design artifact | ⏭️ Skipped (no design.md — acknowledged by orchestrator) |

## Semantic Revert

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Commits logged | 0 |
| Commits tagged in git | N/A |
| Untagged commits | N/A |
| Revert ready | ⚠️ WARNING |

**Note**: Changes are not yet committed — `commits.log` does not exist. This is expected at this stage (pre-commit verification). Flagged as WARNING, not CRITICAL per orchestrator instruction.

---

## Issues Found

**CRITICAL** (must fix before archive):
None

**WARNING** (should fix):
1. `commits.log` does not exist — changes not yet committed. Semantic revert traceability will need to be established when commits are created.
2. Action `dist/index.js` contains a bundled copy of `formatReviewComment` — this is expected behavior (esbuild bundle output) and not dead source code. No action needed.

**SUGGESTION** (nice to have):
1. The action test file (`apps/action/src/index.test.ts:225-250`) re-declares `STATUS_EMOJI` and `SEVERITY_EMOJI` as inline constants for assertion purposes. Consider importing them from `ghagga-core` instead to keep the test DRY and to catch future constant changes.

---

## Verdict

**PASS**

All 6 spec scenarios are compliant with passing tests. All 9 requirements (R1–R6, CC1–CC2) are structurally verified. 1015 tests pass across all 3 projects with zero failures. The extraction is clean — no dead code, no local copies remain in consumers, and the function is properly exported through the core barrel file.
