# Delta for Documentation — docs-v2.1-update

This delta spec addresses 52 documentation issues (28 HIGH, 16 MEDIUM, 8 LOW) discovered after 15 major changes to GHAGGA. All requirements are documentation-only — no application code, database, or API changes.

Changes are grouped by topic (not by file) to ensure cross-file consistency.

---

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Memory Availability Statements (HIGH — 8 files)

All documentation files that describe memory system availability MUST correctly state that review memory is available in **all three** distribution modes:

- **Server (SaaS)**: PostgreSQL with tsvector full-text search
- **CLI**: SQLite via `sql.js` (WASM), stored at `~/.config/ghagga/memory.db`, uses FTS5
- **Action**: SQLite via `sql.js` (WASM), persisted via `@actions/cache`

(Previously: Multiple files incorrectly stated that memory was unavailable or "coming soon" for CLI and/or Action modes.)

Files that MUST be updated:
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/cli.md`
3. `docs/github-action.md`
4. `docs/architecture.md`
5. `docs/memory-system.md`
6. `docs/review-pipeline.md`
7. `docs/README.md`
8. `apps/cli/README.md`

Each file MUST use consistent language describing the storage backend per mode. No file MAY state that memory is "not available", "coming soon", or "server-only" for CLI or Action.

#### Scenario: User reads memory availability in README

- GIVEN a user reading the root `README.md`
- WHEN the user looks for memory system information
- THEN the documentation states memory is available in all three modes (Server, CLI, Action)
- AND it identifies the storage backend for each (PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQLite+cache)

#### Scenario: User reads memory availability in CLI docs

- GIVEN a user reading `docs/cli.md`
- WHEN the user looks for memory system information
- THEN the documentation states CLI uses SQLite via `sql.js` at `~/.config/ghagga/memory.db`
- AND no text states memory is unavailable or server-only

#### Scenario: User reads memory availability in Action docs

- GIVEN a user reading `docs/github-action.md`

#### Scenario: User reads memory-system.md for architecture details

- GIVEN a user reading `docs/memory-system.md`
- WHEN the user reviews storage backend descriptions
- THEN the document lists all three backends (PostgreSQL, SQLite CLI, SQLite Action)
- AND describes FTS5 for SQLite and tsvector for PostgreSQL

#### Scenario: Cross-file consistency of memory statements

- GIVEN all 8 files listed above
- WHEN comparing memory availability descriptions across all files
- THEN no file contradicts another regarding which modes support memory
- AND all files agree on the storage backend per mode

(Previously: The `memory` command and its subcommands were not documented in CLI reference files.)

Files that MUST be updated:
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/cli.md`
3. `docs/quick-start.md`
4. `apps/cli/README.md`

---

### Requirement: Dashboard Memory Management Features (MEDIUM)

Documentation MUST describe the dashboard's memory management capabilities:

**Delete Operations (3 tiers):**
- Tier 1: Delete individual observations — simple confirm dialog
- Tier 2: Clear all observations for a repository — requires typing the repo name to confirm
- Tier 3: Purge all observations — requires typing "DELETE ALL" with a 5-second countdown

**Session Management:**
- Delete individual sessions
- Clean up empty sessions (sessions with no observations)

**UI Features:**
- Severity badges on observations
- StatsBar component showing memory statistics
- ObservationDetailModal for viewing observation details
- Severity and sort filters for observation lists

(Previously: Dashboard memory management features were not documented.)

Files that SHOULD be updated:

- `docs/memory-system.md` (management section)

#### Scenario: User finds dashboard delete tiers

- GIVEN a user reading documentation about dashboard memory management
- WHEN the user looks for how to delete observations
- THEN 3 tiers of deletion are described with their confirmation requirements
- AND Tier 3 (purge all) is clearly marked as destructive with the "DELETE ALL" confirmation and 5-second countdown

#### Scenario: User finds session management features

- WHEN the user looks at CLI-related dependencies
- THEN `@clack/prompts` is listed with its version (^0.9.1) and purpose (CLI TUI)

---

### Requirement: SQLite in Architecture Documentation (MEDIUM)

The `docs/architecture.md` file MUST include SQLite (via `sql.js` WASM) as a storage component used by CLI and Action modes for review memory.

(Previously: Architecture docs only referenced PostgreSQL for storage.)

#### Scenario: User reads architecture for storage components

- GIVEN a developer reading `docs/architecture.md`
- WHEN the user reviews the storage/database architecture section
- THEN SQLite via `sql.js` (WASM) is listed alongside PostgreSQL
- AND its usage contexts (CLI at `~/.config/ghagga/memory.db`, Action via `@actions/cache`) are described

---

### Requirement: Updated Monorepo Tree (MEDIUM)

The `README.md` monorepo directory tree MUST reflect the current project structure. Any new packages, apps, or significant directories added since the tree was last updated MUST be included.

(Previously: Monorepo tree was outdated and did not reflect current structure.)

#### Scenario: User reads monorepo tree in README

- GIVEN a user reading the root `README.md`
- WHEN the user looks at the project structure tree
- THEN the tree matches the actual directory layout of the repository
- AND no significant directories are missing or incorrectly listed

---

- WHEN the user looks at the dashboard pages table
- THEN all current dashboard pages are listed
- AND memory management pages/views are included

---

## MODIFIED Requirements (LOW)

### Requirement: Version Number References (LOW — multiple files)

All version references MUST be updated from `2.0.1` to `2.1.0` where they refer to the current release version.

(Previously: Various files referenced version 2.0.1.)

This applies to version badges, changelog references, and inline version mentions.

#### Scenario: No stale 2.0.1 references remain

- GIVEN all documentation files in the repository
- WHEN searching for version string `2.0.1`
- THEN zero matches are found in current-version contexts (changelogs and historical references MAY retain old version numbers)

#### Scenario: Current version reads 2.1.0

- GIVEN all files that display the current GHAGGA version
- WHEN reading the version number
- THEN the version is `2.1.0`

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### CC1: Cross-File Consistency

When the same fact (memory availability, test count, permissions, version number) appears in multiple files, all files MUST state it identically. Topic-based batching during implementation MUST be used to prevent introducing inconsistencies.

#### Scenario: Memory availability is consistent everywhere

- GIVEN all 8 files that mention memory availability
- WHEN comparing the core claim (memory available in Server, CLI, Action)
- THEN all 8 files agree and none contradicts another

#### Scenario: Test counts are consistent everywhere

- GIVEN all files that mention test counts
- WHEN comparing the total and per-package numbers
- THEN all files show 1,728 total with matching breakdowns

### CC2: No New Inaccuracies

Every factual claim written or modified during this change MUST be verified against the actual source code before committing. The implementation MUST NOT introduce new incorrect statements while fixing old ones.

#### Scenario: Modified content matches source code

- GIVEN any documentation sentence modified during this change
- WHEN cross-referencing the claim against the relevant source file
- THEN the documentation accurately reflects the source code behavior

### CC3: Docsify Rendering

All modified markdown files MUST render correctly in the Docsify documentation site. No changes MAY break existing page rendering, table formatting, or link resolution.

#### Scenario: Docsify renders all modified files

- GIVEN all markdown files modified during this change
- WHEN loaded via the Docsify documentation site
- THEN all headings, tables, code blocks, and links render correctly
- AND no visual regressions are introduced

### CC4: Grep Verification

After implementation, the following grep checks MUST return zero matches (excluding the openspec change folder itself and changelogs):

1. Any file claiming memory is "not available" or "coming soon" for CLI or Action
2. Any outdated test count (the previous stale total)
3. Version string `2.0.1` in current-version contexts

#### Scenario: Grep verification passes

- GIVEN the completed implementation
- WHEN running grep for known stale patterns across documentation files
- THEN zero matches are found for each pattern listed above
