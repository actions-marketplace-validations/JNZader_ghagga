# Design: Global Settings with Per-Repo Override

## Architecture Decision 1: Separate Table vs. Columns on Installations

**Decision**: New `installation_settings` table (1:1 with `installations`).

**Rationale**: The `installations` table is a lightweight identity table (github_id, login, type, is_active). Settings are a rich, evolving blob (JSONB chains, booleans, modes). Mixing them violates SRP and makes the installation upsert path more complex (would need to handle settings defaults on every webhook-created installation). A separate table with lazy-create is cleaner.

**Alternative rejected**: Adding columns directly to `installations` — simpler but couples identity with config, forces defaults on webhook upserts.

## Architecture Decision 2: Resolution at Webhook Time (not Pipeline Time)

**Decision**: Resolve effective settings in `webhook.ts` before dispatching to Inngest. The Inngest event always contains the fully-resolved settings.

**Rationale**: 
- The pipeline (`packages/core`) is distribution-agnostic. It shouldn't know about installations or global settings — it just receives a `ReviewInput` with a resolved `providerChain`.
- Keeps core clean: no DB dependency in core.
- The webhook already has the DB handle and the repo data. Adding one more query (installation settings) is trivial.
- Inngest events become self-contained — if replayed, they use the settings captured at dispatch time.

**Alternative rejected**: Resolve in Inngest function — would work but adds DB call inside the durable function, couples Inngest to the installation concept.

## Architecture Decision 3: Preserve Per-Repo Settings on Global Toggle

**Decision**: When a user switches from custom to global, the repo's `provider_chain` is NOT deleted. Only the `use_global_settings` boolean flips.

**Rationale**: Users might want to experiment with global, then switch back. Deleting their custom chain would be destructive and frustrating. The chain just becomes "inactive" when global is enabled.

## Architecture Decision 4: Dashboard Reuses ProviderChainEditor

**Decision**: The Global Settings page uses the exact same `ProviderChainEditor` component as the per-repo Settings page.

**Rationale**: Same UI, same validation flow, same provider/validate/model-select workflow. Zero new components needed for the chain itself. Only the save target changes (installation vs repo).

## Architecture Decision 5: Installation Selector in Dashboard

**Decision**: For users with multiple installations, the Global Settings page shows a dropdown to pick the installation. For single-installation users, it's auto-selected.

**Rationale**: Most individual users have 1 installation. Orgs might have 1. The edge case of multiple installations (personal + org) is handled by a simple dropdown, not a complex routing scheme.

**Implementation**: Use `user.installationIds` from auth context. Fetch installation details (account_login) from a new lightweight endpoint or extend the existing repo endpoint.

## Schema: installation_settings

```sql
CREATE TABLE installation_settings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  installation_id INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES installations(id),
  provider_chain JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
  ai_review_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  review_mode VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'simple',
  settings JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{...}',  -- DEFAULT_REPO_SETTINGS equivalent
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## API Shape: Installation Settings Response

```typescript
interface InstallationSettingsResponse {
  installationId: number;
  accountLogin: string;
  providerChain: ProviderChainView[];  // masked keys
  aiReviewEnabled: boolean;
  reviewMode: string;
  enableSemgrep: boolean;
  enableTrivy: boolean;
  enableCpd: boolean;
  enableMemory: boolean;
  customRules: string;
  ignorePatterns: string[];
}
```

## API Shape: Extended Repo Settings Response

```typescript
// Extends existing SettingsResponse
interface SettingsResponse {
  // ... existing fields ...
  useGlobalSettings: boolean;
  globalSettings?: InstallationSettingsResponse;  // present when installation settings exist
}
```
