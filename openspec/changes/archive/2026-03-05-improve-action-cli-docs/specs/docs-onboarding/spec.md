# Delta for docs-onboarding

This delta spec extends the existing `docs-onboarding` specification with requirements for the GitHub Action and CLI documentation guides, bringing them to the same quality standard as the SaaS and Self-Hosted guides. It also specifies bug fixes in code examples across multiple documentation files.

---

## ADDED Requirements

### R11 (P0): Fix Bug — Wrong CLI Package Name in `apps/cli/README.md`

All `npx @ghagga/cli` references in `apps/cli/README.md` MUST be changed to `npx ghagga`. All `npm install -g @ghagga/cli` references MUST be changed to `npm install -g ghagga`.

The published npm package name is `ghagga` (verified: `apps/cli/package.json` `"name": "ghagga"`). The `@ghagga/cli` scoped name does not exist and will cause `npm ERR! 404 Not Found` for every user who copies the example.

**Affected occurrences** (9 total in `apps/cli/README.md`):
- Line 6: `npx @ghagga/cli login`
- Line 7: `npx @ghagga/cli review`
- Line 27: `npx @ghagga/cli login`
- Line 36: `npx @ghagga/cli review`
- Line 39: `npx @ghagga/cli review --mode workflow`
- Line 42: `npx @ghagga/cli review --mode consensus`
- Line 45: `npx @ghagga/cli review --mode workflow --verbose`
- Line 51: `npx @ghagga/cli status`
- Line 52: `npx @ghagga/cli logout`
- Line 60: `npm install -g @ghagga/cli`

#### Scenario: User runs npx command from README

- GIVEN a user reading `apps/cli/README.md`
- WHEN the user copies and runs any `npx` command from the Quick Start section
- THEN the command MUST use `npx ghagga` (not `npx @ghagga/cli`)
- AND the command resolves to the published `ghagga` npm package
- AND the command executes successfully (assuming Node.js >= 20 is installed)

#### Scenario: User installs globally from README

- GIVEN a user reading the "Global Installation" section of `apps/cli/README.md`
- WHEN the user copies and runs the install command
- THEN the command MUST be `npm install -g ghagga`
- AND the `ghagga` binary is available in the user's PATH after installation

#### Scenario: No @ghagga/cli references remain

- GIVEN the updated `apps/cli/README.md`
- WHEN searching the file for the string `@ghagga/cli`
- THEN zero matches are found

---

### R12 (P0): Fix Bug — `--config` Inline JSON Example

The `--config` CLI flag expects a **file path**, not an inline JSON string. All documentation examples that pass inline JSON to `--config` MUST be corrected.

**Source code evidence** (`apps/cli/src/commands/review.ts` lines 166-177):
```typescript
function loadConfigFile(repoPath: string, configPath?: string): GhaggaConfig {
  const filePath = configPath
    ? resolve(configPath)
    : join(repoPath, '.ghagga.json');
  // ...
  const raw = readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');
  return JSON.parse(raw) as GhaggaConfig;
}
```

The function calls `resolve(configPath)` then `readFileSync(filePath)`. Passing `'{"reviewLevel": "strict"}'` as the path will cause `ENOENT: no such file or directory`.

**Affected locations**:
- `docs/cli.md` line 104: `ghagga review --mode workflow --config '{"reviewLevel": "strict"}'`
- `docs/configuration.md` line 107: `ghagga review --config '{"reviewLevel": "strict"}'`

Each MUST be replaced with a two-part example:
1. Show the `.ghagga.json` file content
2. Show the CLI command referencing the file path: `ghagga review --config .ghagga.json`

#### Scenario: User uses --config with file path

- GIVEN a user reading the config example in `docs/cli.md` or `docs/configuration.md`
- WHEN the user copies the `--config` example
- THEN the example shows `--config .ghagga.json` (a file path)
- AND a preceding code block shows the contents of `.ghagga.json`
- AND the example works when executed (given the file exists)

#### Scenario: No inline JSON in --config examples

- GIVEN all Markdown files in the repository
- WHEN searching for `--config '{"` or `--config "{`
- THEN zero matches are found

---

### R13 (P0): Fix Bug — Consensus Example Missing `provider: anthropic`

The consensus mode example in `docs/github-action.md` (lines 74-79) passes `api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}` but omits `provider: anthropic`. The Action defaults to `provider: github`, so the Anthropic API key is ignored and the review either uses the GitHub token (wrong model) or fails.

**Source code evidence** (`apps/action/src/index.ts` lines 66-81):
```typescript
if (provider === 'github') {
  apiKey = apiKeyInput || githubToken;  // Ignores ANTHROPIC key
} else if (provider === 'ollama') {
  apiKey = apiKeyInput || 'ollama';
} else {
  apiKey = apiKeyInput;
  if (!apiKey) {
    core.setFailed(`API key is required for provider "${provider}".`);
  }
}
```

Without `provider: anthropic`, the Action uses `provider: github` (default) and ignores the `api-key` input entirely, falling back to `githubToken`.

The example MUST add `provider: anthropic`.

#### Scenario: User copies consensus example from Action guide

- GIVEN a user reading the "Consensus Mode for Security-Sensitive Code" example in `docs/github-action.md`
- WHEN the user copies the YAML workflow snippet
- THEN the snippet includes both `api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}` and `provider: anthropic`
- AND the Action correctly uses Anthropic as the LLM provider

#### Scenario: All Action examples with non-github API keys include provider

- GIVEN all Action YAML examples in `docs/github-action.md`
- WHEN an example passes a non-GitHub API key (e.g., `secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- THEN the example MUST also include the corresponding `provider` input
- AND no example relies on the default `github` provider while passing a third-party API key

---

### R14 (P0): GitHub Action Guide — Prerequisites Section

The `docs/github-action.md` guide MUST include a Prerequisites section at the top (after the title/introduction, before the step-by-step flow).

The Prerequisites section MUST list:
1. A **GitHub repository** (public or private)
2. **Write access** to the repository's `.github/workflows/` directory (or repo admin access)
3. Familiarity with the **pull request workflow** (the Action triggers on PR events)

The Prerequisites section SHOULD include:
- A "Not looking for the Action?" callout linking to alternative modes (SaaS, CLI, Self-Hosted)

#### Scenario: User checks prerequisites before starting

- GIVEN a user reading `docs/github-action.md`
- WHEN the user reads the Prerequisites section
- THEN the section lists the 3 required prerequisites
- AND the user can self-assess whether they can proceed

#### Scenario: User without repo admin access

- GIVEN a user who has read-only access to a GitHub repository
- WHEN the user reads the Prerequisites section
- THEN the requirement for write access to `.github/workflows/` is clearly stated
- AND the user understands they need to request access or use a different repo

---

### R15 (P0): GitHub Action Guide — Step-by-Step Getting Started Flow

The `docs/github-action.md` guide MUST include a numbered step-by-step getting started flow, modeled after `docs/saas-getting-started.md`.

The flow MUST include these steps in order:

**Step 1: Create the workflow file**
- MUST show the complete YAML content for `.github/workflows/review.yml`
- MUST explain each section (trigger, job, steps)
- MUST include a verification checkpoint: "You should now have a file at `.github/workflows/review.yml`"

**Step 2: Commit and push**
- MUST show the git commands to commit and push the workflow file
- MUST include a verification checkpoint: "In your GitHub repository, navigate to Actions tab — you should see the 'Code Review' workflow"

**Step 3: Open a Pull Request**
- MUST explain that the Action triggers on `pull_request` events
- MUST note: for first-time setup, the user needs to open a new PR (or push to an existing one) after the workflow is merged to the default branch
- MUST include a verification checkpoint: "The Actions tab should show a running workflow"

**Step 4: See the review**
- MUST describe what the PR comment looks like (status, findings, timing)
- MUST note first-run timing: ~3-5 minutes (tool installation), subsequent runs ~1-2 minutes
- MUST include a verification checkpoint: "A new comment from `github-actions[bot]` should appear on your PR"

#### Scenario: New user follows Action guide end-to-end

- GIVEN a user with a GitHub repository and write access
- WHEN the user follows `docs/github-action.md` from Step 1 through Step 4
- THEN the user receives an AI code review comment on their PR
- AND every step has a verification checkpoint ("you should now see...")

#### Scenario: User's first run takes longer than expected

- GIVEN a user who completed Steps 1-3 for the first time
- WHEN the Action runs for the first time
- THEN the guide explains that first-run takes ~3-5 minutes (tool installation)
- AND the guide explains that subsequent runs use cache and take ~1-2 minutes

#### Scenario: User merges workflow to non-default branch

- GIVEN a user who creates the workflow file on a feature branch
- WHEN the user opens a PR for that branch
- THEN the guide explains that the workflow runs on the PR itself (the workflow file is in the PR's head branch)

---

### R16 (P1): GitHub Action Guide — Troubleshooting Section

The `docs/github-action.md` guide MUST include a Troubleshooting section with at least 5 common issues.

The section MUST cover:

1. **"Resource not accessible by integration"** (token permissions)
   - Cause: `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks write permission for PR comments
   - Fix: Add `permissions: pull-requests: write` to the workflow job, or check repo Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions

2. **"No review comment posted"**
   - Cause: PR has no file changes (empty diff), or Action was skipped
   - Fix: Ensure the PR has at least one file change; check the `status` output

3. **"First run takes 3-5 minutes"**
   - Cause: Static analysis tools (Semgrep, Trivy, CPD) are being installed for the first time
   - Expected behavior: subsequent runs use `@actions/cache` and take ~1-2 minutes

4. **"Action doesn't trigger"**
   - Cause: Wrong trigger event (e.g., `push` instead of `pull_request`)
   - Fix: Use `on: pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]`

5. **"CI check fails with FAILED status"**
   - Cause: The Action calls `core.setFailed()` when review status is FAILED
   - This is intentional: it signals that the review found critical issues
   - Workaround: Add `continue-on-error: true` to the step if you want advisory-only reviews

Each troubleshooting item MUST include: symptom (what the user sees), cause, and fix/workaround.

#### Scenario: User sees "Resource not accessible by integration"

- GIVEN a user whose workflow runs but the Action fails with a permissions error
- WHEN the user consults the Troubleshooting section
- THEN the section describes the symptom, cause (missing `pull-requests: write`), and fix
- AND the fix includes the exact YAML to add (`permissions:`)

#### Scenario: User's CI fails unexpectedly due to FAILED review status

- GIVEN a user whose PR check status shows "failed" after a GHAGGA review
- WHEN the user consults the Troubleshooting section
- THEN the section explains that `core.setFailed()` is called for FAILED reviews
- AND the section shows the `continue-on-error: true` workaround with a YAML example

#### Scenario: User's Action doesn't trigger at all

- GIVEN a user whose workflow was committed but the Action never runs
- WHEN the user consults the Troubleshooting section
- THEN the section lists common trigger misconfiguration (wrong event, wrong branch filter)
- AND provides the correct `on: pull_request` configuration

---

### R17 (P1): GitHub Action Guide — FAILED Status / `core.setFailed()` Documentation

The `docs/github-action.md` guide MUST document the behavior of the `FAILED` review status in the context of CI checks.

The documentation MUST state:
1. When the review pipeline returns `status: FAILED`, the Action calls `core.setFailed()` (source: `apps/action/src/index.ts` line 188-193)
2. This causes the GitHub Actions check to show as **failed** (red X), which may block merging if branch protection rules require passing checks
3. This is intentional behavior — `FAILED` means the review found critical issues

The documentation MUST show the `continue-on-error: true` workaround:
```yaml
- uses: JNZader/ghagga@v2
  id: review
  continue-on-error: true  # Don't fail CI on review findings
```

The documentation SHOULD explain the two usage patterns:
- **Blocking** (default): review failures block merging — for teams that want strict enforcement
- **Advisory** (`continue-on-error: true`): review findings are informational — for teams adopting gradually

#### Scenario: User configures advisory-only reviews

- GIVEN a user who wants GHAGGA reviews as informational (non-blocking)
- WHEN the user reads the FAILED status documentation
- THEN the documentation shows the `continue-on-error: true` workaround
- AND explains that this allows the PR check to pass regardless of review status

#### Scenario: User configures blocking reviews

- GIVEN a user who wants review failures to block merging
- WHEN the user reads the FAILED status documentation
- THEN the documentation confirms this is the default behavior
- AND explains how branch protection rules interact with the FAILED status

---

### R18 (P1): GitHub Action Guide — Cost Clarity, Expected Output, Diagram, Next Steps

The `docs/github-action.md` guide MUST include:

**Cost section:**
- GitHub Actions minutes: free unlimited for public repos; private repos get 2,000 free minutes/month (then paid)
- GitHub Models LLM: free (default provider, no API key needed)
- Other providers: BYOK — user pays provider directly

**"What to expect" section:**
- Description of the PR comment format: status emoji, summary, findings list with severity/file/line, static analysis results
- Approximate timing: first run ~3-5 min, subsequent ~1-2 min

**Mermaid flow diagram:**
- MUST show the flow: PR event → Action triggers → checkout code → run static analysis → call LLM → post PR comment
- MUST use `mermaid` fenced code block syntax

**Next Steps section:**
- MUST link to: CLI guide, configuration guide, review modes documentation
- SHOULD link to: self-hosted guide for users who need more control

**`.ghagga.json` NOT supported note:**
- MUST state that the Action does NOT read `.ghagga.json` config files
- MUST state that all configuration is via Action inputs (in the workflow YAML)

#### Scenario: User wants to know if the Action is free

- GIVEN a user evaluating the GitHub Action
- WHEN the user reads the Cost section
- THEN the section states: free for public repos (unlimited minutes), free GitHub Models LLM
- AND for private repos: 2,000 free min/month, then paid by GitHub
- AND other LLM providers require the user's own API key

#### Scenario: User looks for a flow diagram

- GIVEN a user wanting to understand how the Action works
- WHEN the user reads the "How It Works" section
- THEN a Mermaid diagram visualizes the flow from PR event to posted comment

#### Scenario: User expects .ghagga.json to work in Action mode

- GIVEN a user who uses `.ghagga.json` with the CLI
- WHEN the user reads the Action guide
- THEN the guide explicitly states that `.ghagga.json` is not supported in Action mode
- AND all configuration is done via Action inputs in the workflow YAML

---

### R19 (P0): CLI Guide — Prerequisites Section

The `docs/cli.md` guide MUST include a Prerequisites section at the top (after the title/introduction, before the step-by-step flow).

The Prerequisites section MUST list:
1. **Node.js >= 20** (verified: `apps/cli/package.json` `"engines": { "node": ">=20.0.0" }`)
2. **Git** (required for `git diff` computation)
3. **A GitHub account** (required for `ghagga login` and free GitHub Models access)

The Prerequisites section SHOULD:
- Note that `docs/quick-start.md` says "Node.js 22+" but `package.json` says ">=20.0.0" — the spec MUST use the `package.json` value (>=20) as the source of truth
- Include a "Not looking for the CLI?" callout linking to alternative modes

#### Scenario: User checks prerequisites before installing

- GIVEN a user reading `docs/cli.md`
- WHEN the user reads the Prerequisites section
- THEN the section lists Node.js >= 20, Git, and a GitHub account
- AND the user can self-assess whether they can proceed

#### Scenario: User has Node.js 18

- GIVEN a user with Node.js 18 installed
- WHEN the user reads the Prerequisites section
- THEN the requirement for Node.js >= 20 is clearly stated
- AND the user understands they need to upgrade before proceeding

---

### R20 (P0): CLI Guide — Step-by-Step Getting Started Flow

The `docs/cli.md` guide MUST include a numbered step-by-step getting started flow.

**Step 1: Install**
- MUST show both `npm install -g ghagga` and `npx ghagga` options
- MUST include a verification checkpoint: `ghagga --version` or `npx ghagga --version`

**Step 2: Login**
- MUST show `ghagga login`
- MUST explain the GitHub Device Flow (code + browser authorization)
- MUST explain that this stores the token at `~/.config/ghagga/config.json`
- MUST include a verification checkpoint: `ghagga status` shows "Logged in"

**Step 3: Review your code**
- MUST show `ghagga review` (simplest case)
- MUST note that staged or uncommitted changes are required (otherwise "No changes detected")
- MUST include a verification checkpoint: review output appears in terminal

**Step 4: Explore options**
- MUST show at least 3 example variations (workflow mode, JSON output, verbose)
- SHOULD link to the full options reference below

#### Scenario: New user follows CLI guide end-to-end

- GIVEN a user with Node.js >= 20, Git, and a GitHub account
- WHEN the user follows `docs/cli.md` from Step 1 through Step 4
- THEN the user sees an AI code review in their terminal
- AND every step has a verification checkpoint

#### Scenario: User has no staged changes

- GIVEN a user who installed and logged in but has no staged/uncommitted changes
- WHEN the user runs `ghagga review`
- THEN the guide explains that the CLI shows "No changes detected"
- AND the guide suggests: stage some changes with `git add` or make uncommitted edits

---

### R21 (P1): CLI Guide — Document All 4 Commands

The `docs/cli.md` guide MUST document all 4 CLI commands: `login`, `logout`, `status`, `review`.

Currently only `review` is detailed. The other 3 commands MUST each have:
- **Description**: what the command does
- **Usage**: command syntax
- **Behavior**: what happens when you run it

**`login`:**
- Authenticates with GitHub using Device Flow
- Stores token at `~/.config/ghagga/config.json` (XDG Base Directory)
- Grants free access to GitHub Models LLM

**`logout`:**
- Clears stored credentials from `~/.config/ghagga/config.json`
- Source: `clearConfig()` in `apps/cli/src/lib/config.ts` calls `saveConfig({})`

**`status`:**
- Shows current auth status (logged in/out, username)
- Shows config file path
- Shows default provider and model
- Source: `apps/cli/src/commands/status.ts`

**`review`:**
- Already documented; MUST retain all existing documentation
- MUST add documentation for the `[path]` positional argument (defaults to `.`)

#### Scenario: User checks authentication status

- GIVEN a user who has run `ghagga login`
- WHEN the user reads the `status` command documentation and runs `ghagga status`
- THEN the documentation describes the expected output: config path, auth status, provider, model

#### Scenario: User wants to clear credentials

- GIVEN a user who wants to remove stored credentials
- WHEN the user reads the `logout` command documentation
- THEN the documentation explains that `ghagga logout` clears `~/.config/ghagga/config.json`

#### Scenario: User reviews a specific directory

- GIVEN a user who wants to review changes in a subdirectory
- WHEN the user reads the `review` command documentation
- THEN the `[path]` positional argument is documented with default value `.`
- AND the user can run `ghagga review ./src` to review only `./src`

---

### R22 (P1): CLI Guide — Troubleshooting Section

The `docs/cli.md` guide MUST include a Troubleshooting section with at least 6 common issues.

1. **"command not found: ghagga"**
   - Cause: npm global bin directory not in PATH, or not installed
   - Fix: use `npx ghagga` instead, or check `npm config get prefix` and add to PATH

2. **"No API key available for provider 'github'"** or "Authentication required"
   - Cause: not logged in
   - Fix: run `ghagga login`

3. **"No changes detected"**
   - Cause: no staged or uncommitted changes in the working tree
   - Fix: make some code changes or stage with `git add`

4. **"Could not get git diff"** or "Not a git repository"
   - Cause: running `ghagga review` outside a git repository
   - Fix: navigate to a git repository root

5. **Static analysis tools silently skipped**
   - Cause: Semgrep/Trivy/CPD not installed locally
   - Expected behavior: tools are skipped silently, review still works (LLM-only)
   - Fix: install tools with `brew install semgrep trivy pmd` (or equivalent)

6. **Login fails / device flow timeout**
   - Cause: browser didn't open, or user didn't authorize in time
   - Fix: manually navigate to the URL shown, enter the code; retry with `ghagga login`

Each troubleshooting item MUST include: symptom, cause, and fix.

#### Scenario: User sees "command not found"

- GIVEN a user who installed `ghagga` globally but `ghagga` is not found
- WHEN the user consults the Troubleshooting section
- THEN the section explains the PATH issue and suggests `npx ghagga` as workaround

#### Scenario: User sees "No changes detected"

- GIVEN a user who runs `ghagga review` in a clean working tree
- WHEN the user consults the Troubleshooting section
- THEN the section explains that staged or uncommitted changes are required
- AND suggests `git add` or making edits

#### Scenario: User wonders why Semgrep isn't running

- GIVEN a user who doesn't have Semgrep installed locally
- WHEN the user runs `ghagga review` and sees no static analysis findings
- THEN the Troubleshooting section explains that tools are silently skipped if not installed
- AND shows how to install them

---

### R23 (P1): CLI Guide — Config Details, Example Output, Environment Variables

The `docs/cli.md` guide MUST include:

**Config storage location:**
- Auth credentials stored at `~/.config/ghagga/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghagga/config.json`)
- Source: `apps/cli/src/lib/config.ts` lines 30-34

**`[path]` positional argument:**
- MUST document that `ghagga review [path]` accepts an optional path (default: `.`)
- Source: `apps/cli/src/index.ts` line 79: `.argument('[path]', 'Path to the repository', '.')`

**`--verbose` behavior:**
- MUST describe that `--verbose` / `-v` shows real-time progress of each pipeline step
- SHOULD show example verbose output

**`GITHUB_TOKEN` env var fallback:**
- MUST document that if `provider` is `github` and no `--api-key` is provided, the CLI falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var, then stored token
- Source: `apps/cli/src/index.ts` lines 124-129

**Environment variables priority:**
- MUST document the full resolution chain: CLI flag > env var (`GHAGGA_PROVIDER`, `GHAGGA_MODEL`, `GHAGGA_API_KEY`) > stored config > defaults

**Example output:**
- MUST show an example of markdown format output (the default terminal output)
- MUST show an example of JSON format output (`--format json`)
- Examples SHOULD be realistic (show status, findings, timing)

#### Scenario: User wants to see JSON output

- GIVEN a user reading the example output section
- WHEN the user looks for JSON format documentation
- THEN a complete JSON output example is shown
- AND the user can pipe it to `jq` or other tools

#### Scenario: User wants to use GITHUB_TOKEN instead of login

- GIVEN a CI/CD environment where `GITHUB_TOKEN` is already set
- WHEN the user reads the environment variables documentation
- THEN the documentation explains that `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used as fallback for the `github` provider
- AND the user can skip `ghagga login` in CI by setting `GITHUB_TOKEN`

#### Scenario: User wants to know where credentials are stored

- GIVEN a security-conscious user
- WHEN the user reads the config documentation
- THEN the exact path `~/.config/ghagga/config.json` is documented
- AND the XDG Base Directory override is mentioned

---

### R24 (P1): CLI Guide — Cost Clarity, Mermaid Diagram, Next Steps

The `docs/cli.md` guide MUST include:

**Cost section:**
- GitHub Models: free (default, requires `ghagga login`)
- Ollama: free (local, 100% offline, no API key)
- Other providers: BYOK — user pays provider directly
- Static analysis: free (local tool execution, no cloud calls)

**Mermaid flow diagram:**
- MUST show: `ghagga review` → compute git diff → run static analysis (if tools installed) → send to LLM → format output → display in terminal
- MUST use `mermaid` fenced code block syntax

**Next Steps section:**
- MUST link to: GitHub Action guide, configuration guide, review modes documentation
- SHOULD link to: BYOK providers, Ollama setup

#### Scenario: User wants to know CLI cost

- GIVEN a user evaluating the CLI
- WHEN the user reads the Cost section
- THEN the section states: free with GitHub Models, free with Ollama (local)
- AND other providers require the user's own API key

#### Scenario: User wants to understand CLI flow

- GIVEN a user wanting to understand how the CLI works
- WHEN the user reads the diagram section
- THEN a Mermaid diagram visualizes the flow from `ghagga review` to terminal output

---

### R25 (P1): CLI README — Fix Missing Providers in Options

The `apps/cli/README.md` Options section (lines 69-83) MUST list all 6 supported providers.

Currently the Options text shows:
```
-p, --provider <provider>  LLM provider: github, openai, anthropic, google
```

Missing: `ollama` and `qwen`.

MUST be updated to:
```
-p, --provider <provider>  LLM provider: github, anthropic, openai, google, ollama, qwen
```

This matches the BYOK section below it (which already lists ollama) and the `docs/cli.md` options table.

#### Scenario: User looks for Ollama in Options section

- GIVEN a user reading the Options section of `apps/cli/README.md`
- WHEN the user looks for the `--provider` option
- THEN `ollama` and `qwen` are listed among the supported providers

---

## MODIFIED Requirements

### R5 (Modification): Quick-Start Decision Matrix — Fix Contradictory "Recommended" Labels

**Previously**: The decision matrix table in `docs/quick-start.md` marks SaaS as "⭐ Recommended" (line 7), but the GitHub Action section heading says "(Recommended)" (line 14: `## GitHub Action (Recommended)`).

**Updated**: The SaaS mode MUST be the only mode marked as "Recommended" in the decision matrix table. The GitHub Action section heading MUST NOT include "(Recommended)". It MAY use a neutral label or no label.

The table row for SaaS (line 7) MUST retain the "⭐ Recommended" marker.
The Action section heading (line 14) MUST be changed from `## GitHub Action (Recommended)` to `## GitHub Action`.

#### Scenario: User reads quick-start and identifies recommended mode

- GIVEN a user reading `docs/quick-start.md`
- WHEN the user reads the decision matrix table AND the individual section headings
- THEN exactly ONE mode is labeled "Recommended" (SaaS)
- AND no contradictory "Recommended" labels exist on other modes

#### Scenario: Action section is neutral

- GIVEN a user reading the GitHub Action section of `docs/quick-start.md`
- WHEN the user reads the section heading
- THEN the heading is `## GitHub Action` (no "Recommended" label)

---

### R7 (Modification): Cost Transparency — Extended to Action and CLI

**Previously**: Cost transparency was specified for SaaS guide and landing page only.

**Updated**: Cost information MUST also appear in:
- `docs/github-action.md` — Actions minutes cost model (free public, 2000 min free private)
- `docs/cli.md` — free with GitHub Models, free with Ollama, BYOK for others

This extends R7 from the existing `docs-onboarding` spec without contradicting it.

#### Scenario: User finds cost info in Action guide

- GIVEN a user reading `docs/github-action.md`
- WHEN the user looks for cost information
- THEN a Cost section states: free for public repos, private repos consume GitHub Actions minutes (2,000 free/month)
- AND GitHub Models LLM is free

#### Scenario: User finds cost info in CLI guide

- GIVEN a user reading `docs/cli.md`
- WHEN the user looks for cost information
- THEN a Cost section states: free with GitHub Models and Ollama, BYOK for others

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### CC4: Bug-Free Code Examples

All code examples across ALL documentation files MUST be executable without errors when copied verbatim (given the documented prerequisites are met).

**Specific prohibitions:**
- MUST NOT contain `@ghagga/cli` as a package name (correct: `ghagga`)
- MUST NOT pass inline JSON to `--config` (correct: pass a file path)
- MUST NOT pass a provider-specific API key without the corresponding `provider` input
- MUST NOT list providers that don't exist, or omit providers that do exist

#### Scenario: All CLI examples use correct package name

- GIVEN all Markdown files in the repository
- WHEN searching for `@ghagga/cli`
- THEN zero matches are found (excluding changelogs and the openspec change folder itself)

#### Scenario: All --config examples use file paths

- GIVEN all Markdown files in the repository
- WHEN searching for `--config` followed by a JSON string literal
- THEN zero matches are found

#### Scenario: All Action examples have matching provider and api-key

- GIVEN all Action YAML examples in documentation
- WHEN an example includes a non-GitHub `api-key`
- THEN the corresponding `provider` input is explicitly set

### CC5: Structural Quality Standard

Both the `docs/github-action.md` and `docs/cli.md` guides MUST follow the same structural quality standard as `docs/saas-getting-started.md`:

1. Prerequisites section
2. Numbered step-by-step flow with verification checkpoints
3. Mermaid flow diagram
4. Reference tables (inputs/options)
5. Troubleshooting section (4+ scenarios)
6. Cost clarity section
7. Example output or "What to expect" section
8. Next Steps links

Each guide SHOULD be between 200-350 lines (matching the range of existing quality guides: SaaS at 220, Self-Hosted at 424).

#### Scenario: GitHub Action guide matches quality standard

- GIVEN the updated `docs/github-action.md`
- WHEN evaluating against the quality checklist (8 items above)
- THEN all 8 structural elements are present

#### Scenario: CLI guide matches quality standard

- GIVEN the updated `docs/cli.md`
- WHEN evaluating against the quality checklist (8 items above)
- THEN all 8 structural elements are present

### CC1 (Extended): Link Integrity

All links in modified files MUST be valid. In particular:
- `docs/github-action.md` MUST link to `cli.md`, `configuration.md`, `saas-getting-started.md`
- `docs/cli.md` MUST link to `github-action.md`, `configuration.md`, `saas-getting-started.md`
- `apps/cli/README.md` MUST link to the GitHub repository and documentation site

#### Scenario: Cross-links between Action and CLI guides

- GIVEN the updated `docs/github-action.md` and `docs/cli.md`
- WHEN following links between them
- THEN `github-action.md` links to `cli.md` and vice versa
- AND all links resolve to existing files
