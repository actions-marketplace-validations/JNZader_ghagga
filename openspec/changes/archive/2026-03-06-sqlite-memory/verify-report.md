### Cross-Cutting Concerns

| CC | Description | Verdict | Notes |
|----|-------------|---------|-------|
| CC1 | Graceful degradation | ✅ PASS | CLI and Action wrap `SqliteMemoryStorage.create()` in try/catch; pipeline's existing search/persist error handling preserved |
| CC2 | sql.js WASM loading | ✅ PASS | Works in CLI (Node.js) and Action (ncc-bundled via fts5-sql-bundle) |
| CC3 | Thread safety | ✅ PASS | JSDoc documents single-process constraint; no locking implemented (correct for CLI/Action) |

### Deviations from Spec (Accepted)

1. **`fts5-sql-bundle` instead of `sql.js`**: The implementation uses `fts5-sql-bundle` (^1.0.2) instead of `sql.js` (^1.11.0) as specified. This is a sql.js build with FTS5 support enabled — standard sql.js doesn't compile FTS5. Functionally equivalent and necessary for R3.2/R5. **Accepted — correct engineering decision.**

2. **Action cache key format**: Cache key uses `repoFullName.replace('/', '-')` producing `ghagga-memory-owner-repo` instead of spec's `ghagga-memory-owner/repo`. This avoids potential issues with `/` in cache keys. **Accepted — defensive adaptation.**

3. **`DatabaseWithParams` interface**: `sqlite.ts` defines a wrapper interface to add typed `exec()` with params since `fts5-sql-bundle` types don't include the params overload. **Accepted — type safety improvement.**

## 3. Coherence (Design Match)

### Architecture Decisions

| AD | Decision | Verdict | Notes |
|----|----------|---------|-------|
| AD1 | sql.js over better-sqlite3 | ✅ FOLLOWED | fts5-sql-bundle (sql.js variant) used; pure WASM, ncc-compatible |
| AD2 | FTS5 with default unicode61 tokenizer | ✅ FOLLOWED | No porter stemmer configured; OR-joined keywords with BM25 |
| AD3 | Interface in types.ts | ✅ FOLLOWED | MemoryStorage + MemoryObservationRow in `packages/core/src/types.ts` |
| AD4 | SqliteMemoryStorage in core | ✅ FOLLOWED | In `packages/core/src/memory/sqlite.ts`, shared by CLI and Action |
| AD5 | Async factory pattern | ✅ FOLLOWED | `static async create(filePath)`, private constructor |
| AD6 | Immutable cache keys | ✅ FOLLOWED | `ghagga-memory-{repo}` key with first-writer-wins semantics |
| AD7 | PostgresMemoryStorage in apps/server | ✅ FOLLOWED | In `apps/server/src/memory/postgres.ts`, maintains clean dependency graph |
| AD8 | Fire-and-forget persist → await | ✅ FOLLOWED | Pipeline now awaits persist with `.catch()` for SQLite correctness |

### File Changes Match

All 18 files listed in the design's file changes table have been verified as created or modified.

## 5. Spec Compliance Matrix (S1–S23)

| S1 | CLI first review with memory | `cli/review.test.ts` (SqliteMemoryStorage creation, close called), `sqlite.test.ts` (schema init, empty search) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S2 | CLI second review same repo | `sqlite.test.ts` (file persistence + reload), `search.test.ts` (returns past observations) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S3 | CLI review different repo | `sqlite.test.ts` (project scoping — other project observations not returned) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S4 | CLI --no-memory flag | `cli/review.test.ts` (memory disabled, no storage created) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S5 | CLI no git remote | `git.test.ts` (fallback to "local/unknown") | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S6 | Action first run (cache miss) | `action/index.test.ts` (restoreCache miss, fresh DB created, saveCache called) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S7 | Action subsequent run (cache hit) | `action/index.test.ts` (restoreCache hit, existing DB loaded) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S8 | Action enable-memory: false | `action/index.test.ts` (no cache restore/save, no storage created) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S9 | Action cache evicted | `action/index.test.ts` (cache miss handled gracefully, fresh DB) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S10 | Server SaaS path unchanged | `server/review.test.ts` (PostgresMemoryStorage delegates to ghagga-db) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S11 | Memory search with results | `sqlite.test.ts` (FTS5 keyword match returns results), `search.test.ts` (formats context) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S12 | Memory search no results | `sqlite.test.ts` (nonexistent keyword → empty), `search.test.ts` (empty → null context) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S13 | Content-hash deduplication | `sqlite.test.ts` (same content within 15-min → returns existing, no duplicate) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S14 | Dedup window expired | `sqlite.test.ts` (expired window → new row inserted) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S15 | TopicKey upsert | `sqlite.test.ts` (same topicKey → update, revisionCount incremented) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S16 | FTS5 keyword matching | `sqlite.test.ts` (multi-keyword OR match, non-matching excluded, BM25 ordered) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S17 | Database file does not exist | `sqlite.test.ts` (fresh DB with full schema created) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S18 | Database file corrupted | `cli/review.test.ts`, `action/index.test.ts` (create failure caught, review proceeds) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S19 | WASM load failure | `cli/review.test.ts`, `action/index.test.ts` (create failure caught, memoryStorage undefined) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S20 | Pipeline with memoryStorage undefined | `pipeline.test.ts` (memory disabled path, persist not called, memoryContext null) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S21 | Core package independence | Verified via `grep`: zero ghagga-db imports in core, not in package.json | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S22 | Session lifecycle | `sqlite.test.ts` (createSession returns id, endSession sets summary) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |
| S23 | Git remote URL normalization | `git.test.ts` (HTTPS, SSH, ssh://, no-suffix, GitLab — all 5 formats) | ✅ PASS | COMPLIANT |

**23 / 23 scenarios: COMPLIANT**
