# Spec: Memory Detail View — Severity Expansion + Dashboard UI Enhancements

> **Domain**: Memory (Core + Dashboard)  
> **Change**: `memory-detail-view`  
> **Type**: DELTA (extends `openspec/specs/memory-storage/spec.md`)  
> **Status**: Draft  
> **Depends on**: `dashboard-memory-management` (which implemented delete/clear/purge + ConfirmDialog + Toast)  

## Overview

This specification defines two areas of change:

1. **Backend**: Expand the memory significance filter to include `medium` severity findings, add a `severity` column to the observation data model (both PostgreSQL and SQLite), and propagate severity through the persistence and query pipeline.

2. **Dashboard**: Enhance the Memory page with severity badges, PR links, an observation detail modal, stats bar, severity filter, and sort options — transforming the page from a basic observation browser into a comprehensive memory management interface.

All observations with `NULL` severity (pre-existing data) MUST be handled gracefully throughout.

---

## Requirements

### R1: Expand Significance Filter to Include Medium Severity

The `isSignificantFinding()` function in `packages/core/src/memory/persist.ts` MUST be updated to return `true` for `medium` severity findings in addition to `critical` and `high`.

The function MUST continue to return `false` for `low` and `info` severity findings.

#### Scenario: S1 — Medium severity finding is persisted

- GIVEN a review result contains a finding with `severity: 'medium'` and `category: 'performance'`
- WHEN `persistReviewObservations()` is called
- THEN the finding MUST be saved as a memory observation via `saveObservation()`
- AND the observation's content MUST include `[MEDIUM] performance`

#### Scenario: S2 — Low severity finding is still excluded

- GIVEN a review result contains only a finding with `severity: 'low'`
- WHEN `persistReviewObservations()` is called
- THEN no observations MUST be saved (aside from no session being created)
- AND `saveObservation()` MUST NOT be called

#### Scenario: S3 — Mixed severities: all three significant levels captured

- GIVEN a review result contains 3 findings: one `critical`, one `high`, one `medium`
- WHEN `persistReviewObservations()` is called
- THEN 3 finding observations MUST be saved (plus 1 summary observation)
- AND all 3 findings MUST pass the significance filter

---

### R2: Add `severity` Column to PostgreSQL Schema

A `severity` column MUST be added to the `memoryObservations` table in `packages/db/src/schema.ts`.

The column MUST:
- Be of type `varchar('severity', { length: 10 })`
- Be nullable (no `.notNull()`) for backward compatibility with existing observations
- Accept values: `'critical'`, `'high'`, `'medium'`, `'low'`, `'info'`, or `NULL`

A corresponding migration file `packages/db/drizzle/0006_add_severity_column.sql` MUST be created containing:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "memory_observations" ADD COLUMN "severity" varchar(10);
```

#### Scenario: S4 — New observation stored with severity

- GIVEN the `severity` column exists in `memory_observations`
- WHEN a new observation is inserted with `severity: 'medium'`
- THEN the `severity` column MUST contain `'medium'`

#### Scenario: S5 — Existing observations have NULL severity

- GIVEN the migration has been applied to a database with existing observations
- WHEN a SELECT query reads existing observations
- THEN the `severity` column MUST be `NULL` for pre-existing rows
- AND no error MUST occur

---

### R3: Add `severity` Column to SQLite Schema

The SQLite schema in `packages/core/src/memory/sqlite.ts` MUST be updated to include `severity TEXT` in the `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS memory_observations` statement.

For existing SQLite databases, an `ALTER TABLE memory_observations ADD COLUMN severity TEXT` statement MUST be executed during initialization. The implementation MUST handle the case where the column already exists (e.g., by catching the "duplicate column name" error or checking the schema first).

#### Scenario: S6 — New SQLite database includes severity column

- GIVEN a fresh SQLite database is created
- WHEN the schema initialization runs
- THEN the `memory_observations` table MUST include a `severity` column of type TEXT

#### Scenario: S7 — Existing SQLite database gets severity column via migration

- GIVEN an existing SQLite database WITHOUT a `severity` column
- WHEN the application initializes the database
- THEN an `ALTER TABLE` MUST add the `severity` column
- AND existing observations MUST NOT be modified

#### Scenario: S8 — Migration is idempotent for SQLite

- GIVEN the `severity` column already exists in the SQLite database
- WHEN the application initializes the database
- THEN no error MUST occur
- AND the schema MUST remain unchanged

---

### R4: Update `saveObservation` Interface and Implementations

The `saveObservation` method in the `MemoryStorage` interface (`packages/core/src/types.ts`) MUST accept an optional `severity` field:

```typescript
saveObservation(data: {
  sessionId?: number;
  project: string;
  type: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  topicKey?: string;
  filePaths?: string[];
  severity?: string;  // NEW
}): Promise<MemoryObservationRow>;
```

The PostgreSQL implementation in `packages/db/src/queries.ts` MUST:
- Include `severity` in the INSERT statement when provided
- Preserve existing `severity` value during topic-key upsert (update to new severity if provided)
- Include `severity` in the returned row

The SQLite implementation in `packages/core/src/memory/sqlite.ts` MUST:
- Include `severity` in the INSERT statement when provided
- Store `NULL` when severity is not provided

The `persistReviewObservations()` function in `packages/core/src/memory/persist.ts` MUST pass `finding.severity` to `saveObservation()` for each finding observation. The summary observation (PR review) MAY omit severity or use `null`.

#### Scenario: S9 — Severity persisted through pipeline

- GIVEN a review finding with `severity: 'high'`
- WHEN `persistReviewObservations()` calls `saveObservation()`
- THEN the `data` argument MUST include `severity: 'high'`
- AND the stored observation MUST have `severity: 'high'`

#### Scenario: S10 — Summary observation has no severity

- GIVEN a review with significant findings
- WHEN `persistReviewObservations()` saves the summary observation ("PR #N review: status")
- THEN the `data` argument SHOULD NOT include `severity` or SHOULD include `severity: undefined`
- AND the stored observation MUST have `severity: NULL`

#### Scenario: S11 — Topic-key upsert preserves/updates severity

- GIVEN an existing observation with `topicKey: 'auth-pattern'` and `severity: 'high'`
- WHEN a new observation with `topicKey: 'auth-pattern'` and `severity: 'medium'` is saved
- THEN the existing observation MUST be updated with `severity: 'medium'`

---

### R5: Update Type Definitions

The `MemoryObservationRow` interface in `packages/core/src/types.ts` MUST be extended with:
```typescript
severity: string | null;
```

The `MemoryObservationDetail` interface in `packages/core/src/types.ts` MUST be extended with:
```typescript
severity: string | null;
```

The `Observation` interface in `apps/dashboard/src/lib/types.ts` MUST be extended with:
```typescript
severity: string | null;
topicKey: string | null;
revisionCount: number;
updatedAt: string;
```

The `MemorySession` interface in `apps/dashboard/src/lib/types.ts` SHOULD be extended with:
```typescript
severityCounts?: Record<string, number>;  // e.g., { critical: 2, high: 5, medium: 3 }
```

#### Scenario: S12 — Dashboard receives severity in observation data

- GIVEN the API returns observations with the `severity` field
- WHEN the Dashboard renders observation cards
- THEN each observation object MUST have a `severity` property (string or null)

---

### R6: Update Queries to Include Severity

The `getObservationsBySession` function in `packages/db/src/queries.ts` MUST include the `severity` column in its SELECT results.

The `searchObservations` function in `packages/db/src/queries.ts` MUST include the `severity` column in its returned `MemoryObservationRow[]`.

The `getSessionsByProject` function in `packages/db/src/queries.ts` SHOULD be enhanced to return severity distribution per session. This MAY be implemented as:
- A subquery that counts observations by severity for each session
- A JSON aggregate column: `severityCounts`

The `mapToDetail` function in `packages/core/src/memory/sqlite.ts` MUST map the `severity` column to the `MemoryObservationDetail.severity` field.

#### Scenario: S13 — Observations returned with severity

- GIVEN a session has observations with severities: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, and `NULL`
- WHEN `getObservationsBySession(db, sessionId)` is called
- THEN each returned observation MUST include a `severity` field
- AND observations with severity MUST return the severity string
- AND observations without severity MUST return `null`

#### Scenario: S14 — Session severity distribution

- GIVEN a session has 2 `critical`, 3 `high`, and 1 `medium` observation
- WHEN `getSessionsByProject(db, project)` is called
- THEN the session entry SHOULD include severity counts: `{ critical: 2, high: 3, medium: 1 }`

#### Scenario: S15 — SQLite mapToDetail includes severity

- GIVEN a SQLite observation row with `severity: 'medium'`
- WHEN `mapToDetail()` is called
- THEN the returned `MemoryObservationDetail` MUST have `severity: 'medium'`

#### Scenario: S16 — SQLite mapToDetail handles NULL severity

- GIVEN a SQLite observation row with no `severity` column value (NULL)
- WHEN `mapToDetail()` is called
- THEN the returned `MemoryObservationDetail` MUST have `severity: null`

---

### R7: Dashboard — Severity Badge on ObservationCard

Each `ObservationCard` in `apps/dashboard/src/pages/Memory.tsx` MUST display a severity badge when the observation has a non-null severity.

The badge MUST:
- Use the existing `SeverityBadge` component from `apps/dashboard/src/components/SeverityBadge.tsx`
- Be positioned in the card header area, next to the observation type badge
- NOT be rendered when severity is `null`

#### Scenario: S17 — Severity badge displayed for observation with severity

- GIVEN an observation with `severity: 'high'`
- WHEN the `ObservationCard` renders
- THEN a severity badge with text "High" and orange styling MUST be visible
- AND the badge MUST use the `SeverityBadge` component

#### Scenario: S18 — No severity badge for NULL severity

- GIVEN an observation with `severity: null`
- WHEN the `ObservationCard` renders
- THEN no severity badge MUST be shown
- AND the card MUST still render correctly with the type badge only

---

### R8: Dashboard — PR Link on ObservationCard and SessionItem

Each `ObservationCard` SHOULD display a PR link badge (e.g., "PR #42") when the observation's session has a `prNumber`.

Each `SessionItem` MUST display a PR link (e.g., "PR #42") linking to `https://github.com/{project}/pull/{prNumber}` when `prNumber` is available.

#### Scenario: S19 — PR link displayed on SessionItem

- GIVEN a session with `project: 'acme/widgets'` and `prNumber: 42`
- WHEN the `SessionItem` renders
- THEN a clickable "PR #42" link MUST be visible
- AND clicking it MUST open `https://github.com/acme/widgets/pull/42` in a new tab

#### Scenario: S20 — No PR link when prNumber is absent

- GIVEN a session with `prNumber: null` or `prNumber: 0`
- WHEN the `SessionItem` renders
- THEN no PR link MUST be shown

---

### R9: Dashboard — Enhanced ObservationCard Display

Each `ObservationCard` MUST be enhanced with the following display improvements:

1. **Revision count badge**: When `revisionCount > 1`, display a badge like "3 revisions"
2. **File path chips**: Display file paths as styled chips/tags (not plain text)
3. **Content styling**: Observation content MUST use `font-mono` for code-like formatting with `whitespace-pre-wrap`
4. **Relative timestamps**: Display `createdAt` as relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago") using `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`

The card MUST remain clickable to open the observation detail modal (R10).

#### Scenario: S21 — Revision count badge shown for revised observations

- GIVEN an observation with `revisionCount: 5`
- WHEN the `ObservationCard` renders
- THEN a "5 revisions" badge MUST be visible

#### Scenario: S22 — No revision badge for single-revision observations

- GIVEN an observation with `revisionCount: 1`
- WHEN the `ObservationCard` renders
- THEN no revision count badge MUST be shown

#### Scenario: S23 — Relative timestamp display

- GIVEN an observation created 3 hours ago
- WHEN the `ObservationCard` renders
- THEN the timestamp MUST display as "3 hours ago" (or similar relative format)
- AND the full ISO timestamp SHOULD be available as a tooltip (via `title` attribute)

#### Scenario: S24 — File paths displayed as chips

- GIVEN an observation with `filePaths: ['src/auth.ts', 'src/middleware.ts']`
- WHEN the `ObservationCard` renders
- THEN "src/auth.ts" and "src/middleware.ts" MUST be displayed as styled chip elements
- AND the chips MUST use `font-mono` styling

---

### R10: Dashboard — Observation Detail Modal

A new observation detail modal MUST be created at `apps/dashboard/src/components/ObservationDetailModal.tsx`.

The modal MUST open when the user clicks on an `ObservationCard`.

The modal MUST display:
- Observation title (large heading)
- Severity badge (using `SeverityBadge` component, if severity is non-null)
- Type badge
- Full content with code-like formatting (`font-mono`, `whitespace-pre-wrap`)
- All file paths (each as a styled element)
- Topic key (if non-null), displayed with a label: "Topic: {topicKey}"
- Revision count (e.g., "Revision 3 of this topic")
- Created at timestamp (both relative and absolute)
- Updated at timestamp (both relative and absolute, if different from createdAt)

The modal MUST:
- Be rendered via a portal/overlay pattern (consistent with existing `ConfirmDialog`)
- Have a semi-transparent backdrop
- Be closeable by clicking the backdrop, pressing Escape, or clicking an X button
- Be vertically scrollable if content overflows
- Follow the dark theme design of the dashboard

#### Scenario: S25 — Detail modal opens on card click

- GIVEN the user is viewing observations for a session
- WHEN the user clicks on an `ObservationCard`
- THEN a detail modal MUST open with the full observation details
- AND the modal MUST be centered on screen with a backdrop

#### Scenario: S26 — Detail modal displays all fields

- GIVEN an observation with:
  - `severity: 'critical'`
  - `type: 'bugfix'`
  - `title: 'Null pointer in auth middleware'`
  - `content: '[CRITICAL] bug\nFile: src/auth.ts:42\nIssue: Null pointer...'`
  - `filePaths: ['src/auth.ts']`
  - `topicKey: 'auth-null-check'`
  - `revisionCount: 3`
  - `createdAt: '2026-03-01T10:00:00Z'`
  - `updatedAt: '2026-03-05T14:30:00Z'`
- WHEN the detail modal is open for this observation
- THEN all fields MUST be visible with appropriate formatting
- AND the severity badge MUST be red ("Critical")
- AND the topic key MUST be displayed as "Topic: auth-null-check"
- AND the revision count MUST be displayed as "Revision 3 of this topic"

#### Scenario: S27 — Detail modal handles NULL fields gracefully

- GIVEN an observation with `severity: null`, `topicKey: null`, `revisionCount: 1`
- WHEN the detail modal is open for this observation
- THEN no severity badge MUST be shown
- AND no topic key section MUST be shown
- AND no revision information MUST be shown (or it SHOULD show "1 revision")

#### Scenario: S28 — Close detail modal with Escape

- GIVEN the observation detail modal is open
- WHEN the user presses the Escape key
- THEN the modal MUST close
- AND the observations list MUST be visible again

#### Scenario: S29 — Close detail modal with backdrop click

- GIVEN the observation detail modal is open
- WHEN the user clicks on the backdrop (outside the modal content)
- THEN the modal MUST close

---

### R11: Dashboard — Stats Bar

A stats bar MUST be displayed at the top of the observations area in the Memory page.

The stats bar MUST show:
- **Total count**: "N observations" where N is the total count of observations in the current view
- **Severity breakdown**: Color-coded count chips for each severity level present (e.g., red "3 critical", orange "5 high", yellow "2 medium")
- **Type breakdown**: Count chips for each observation type present (e.g., "4 pattern", "2 bugfix", "1 learning")

The stats bar MUST update dynamically when filters (severity filter, type filter) change — it SHOULD reflect the filtered subset, not the total.

#### Scenario: S30 — Stats bar displays counts

- GIVEN the current view has 10 observations: 2 critical, 3 high, 5 medium; 4 pattern, 3 bugfix, 3 learning
- WHEN the stats bar renders
- THEN it MUST display "10 observations"
- AND severity chips: "2 critical" (red), "3 high" (orange), "5 medium" (yellow)
- AND type chips: "4 pattern", "3 bugfix", "3 learning"

#### Scenario: S31 — Stats bar updates with filters

- GIVEN the severity filter is set to "Critical"
- AND 2 of 10 observations are critical
- WHEN the stats bar renders
- THEN it MUST display "2 observations"
- AND only the "2 critical" severity chip MUST be shown

---

### R12: Dashboard — Severity Filter

A severity filter dropdown MUST be added to the Memory page alongside the existing type filter.

The filter MUST:
- Display options: "All severities" (default), "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low", "Info"
- Filter the observation list client-side
- Persist the selected value while the page is active (reset on navigation away)
- Work independently of and in combination with the existing type filter

#### Scenario: S32 — Filter by single severity

- GIVEN the observations list contains observations with critical, high, and medium severities
- WHEN the user selects "High" from the severity filter
- THEN only observations with `severity: 'high'` MUST be displayed
- AND the stats bar MUST update to reflect the filtered subset

#### Scenario: S33 — Filter shows observations with NULL severity

- GIVEN some observations have `severity: null`
- WHEN the "All severities" filter is selected (default)
- THEN all observations MUST be shown, including those with NULL severity

#### Scenario: S34 — Combined severity + type filter

- GIVEN observations exist with various severities and types
- WHEN the user selects severity "Critical" AND type "bugfix"
- THEN only observations matching BOTH criteria MUST be displayed

---

### R13: Dashboard — Sort Options

Sort options MUST be provided for the observation list in the Memory page.

The available sort options MUST be:
- **Newest first** (default): Sort by `createdAt` descending
- **Oldest first**: Sort by `createdAt` ascending
- **Severity**: Sort by severity level descending (critical > high > medium > low > info > null)
- **Most revised**: Sort by `revisionCount` descending

The sort MUST be applied client-side after filtering.

#### Scenario: S35 — Sort by severity

- GIVEN observations with severities: medium, critical, null, high
- WHEN the user selects "Severity" sort
- THEN the observations MUST be ordered: critical, high, medium, null

#### Scenario: S36 — Sort by most revised

- GIVEN observations with revision counts: 1, 5, 3, 2
- WHEN the user selects "Most revised" sort
- THEN the observations MUST be ordered: 5, 3, 2, 1

#### Scenario: S37 — Default sort is newest first

- GIVEN the user has not changed the sort option
- THEN observations MUST be sorted by `createdAt` descending (newest first)

---

### R14: Dashboard — SessionItem Enhancements

Each `SessionItem` in the Memory page MUST be enhanced with:

1. **PR link**: Clickable link to the GitHub PR (R8)
2. **Severity summary**: Small colored dots or count text showing the distribution of severities in that session (e.g., "2● 3● 1●" with critical=red, high=orange, medium=yellow dots)

#### Scenario: S38 — Session shows severity summary

- GIVEN a session with observations: 1 critical, 2 high, 3 medium
- WHEN the `SessionItem` renders
- THEN severity summary indicators MUST be visible
- AND they MUST use the correct colors (red for critical, orange for high, yellow for medium)

#### Scenario: S39 — Session with no severity data

- GIVEN a session where all observations have `severity: null` (pre-existing data)
- WHEN the `SessionItem` renders
- THEN no severity summary MUST be shown (or a neutral "no severity data" indicator)

---

### R15: Dashboard — Relative Time Formatting

Relative time formatting MUST be implemented using the browser's built-in `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` API.

A utility function MUST be created (e.g., `formatRelativeTime(date: string): string`) that:
- Accepts an ISO 8601 date string
- Returns a human-readable relative time string (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago", "just now")
- Handles edge cases: future dates, very old dates (> 1 year)

No external date libraries (moment.js, dayjs, date-fns) MUST be added.

#### Scenario: S40 — Recent timestamp

- GIVEN a timestamp from 45 minutes ago
- WHEN `formatRelativeTime()` is called
- THEN it MUST return "45 minutes ago" (or similar)

#### Scenario: S41 — Old timestamp

- GIVEN a timestamp from 30 days ago
- WHEN `formatRelativeTime()` is called
- THEN it MUST return "30 days ago" or "1 month ago" (either is acceptable)

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### CC1: Backward Compatibility with NULL Severity

All code paths that read observations MUST handle `severity: null` gracefully:
- Dashboard components: conditional rendering (show badge only if severity is non-null)
- Sort by severity: NULL values sort last
- Filter by severity: "All severities" includes NULL severity observations
- Stats bar: observations with NULL severity are counted but not included in severity breakdown chips

### CC2: Severity Type Safety

The `SeverityBadge` component accepts `Finding['severity']` (typed as `'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'info'`), but observation severity is `string | null`. A type guard MUST be used before passing severity to `SeverityBadge`:

```typescript
const validSeverities = ['critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'info'] as const;
function isValidSeverity(s: string | null): s is Finding['severity'] {
  return s != null && validSeverities.includes(s as any);
}
```

### CC3: No New Dependencies

This change MUST NOT add any new npm dependencies. All functionality uses existing packages and browser APIs:
- `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` for relative time formatting
- Existing `SeverityBadge` component for severity display
- Existing Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Existing `cn()` utility for conditional classes

### CC4: Dark Theme Consistency

All new UI elements MUST follow the existing dark theme design:
- Background: `bg-gray-900`, `bg-gray-800` for cards
- Text: `text-gray-100`, `text-gray-400` for secondary
- Borders: `border-gray-700`
- Severity colors from existing `SeverityBadge` (red/orange/yellow/blue/gray with opacity)

### CC5: Modal Pattern Consistency

The observation detail modal MUST follow the same portal/overlay pattern established by the existing `ConfirmDialog` component:
- Portal rendering to `document.body`
- Backdrop with `bg-black/50` (or similar)
- Centered with `flex items-center justify-center`
- Escape key and backdrop click to close
- Scroll handling for long content

---

## Edge Cases

### E1: Observation with very long content

- GIVEN an observation with content exceeding 5000 characters
- WHEN the detail modal is open
- THEN the modal MUST be scrollable
- AND the content MUST NOT overflow the viewport

#### Scenario: S42

- GIVEN an observation with 10,000 character content
- WHEN the detail modal is rendered
- THEN vertical scrolling MUST be available within the modal

### E2: Observation with many file paths

- GIVEN an observation with 20+ file paths
- WHEN the ObservationCard renders
- THEN file paths SHOULD be truncated (e.g., show first 3 + "and 17 more")
- AND the detail modal MUST show all file paths

#### Scenario: S43

- GIVEN an observation with 25 file paths
- WHEN the ObservationCard renders
- THEN it SHOULD display at most 5 file paths with a "+20 more" indicator

### E3: Session with 0 observations (after deletion)

- GIVEN a session where all observations have been deleted
- WHEN the SessionItem renders
- THEN it MUST show "0 observations" and no severity summary

#### Scenario: S44

- GIVEN a session with 0 observations
- WHEN the stats bar renders for that session's view
- THEN it MUST show "0 observations" with no severity or type chips

### E4: All observations have NULL severity

- GIVEN a project where all observations pre-date the severity feature
- WHEN the Memory page renders
- THEN no severity badges MUST be shown on any cards
- AND the severity filter SHOULD still be available but filtering to any specific severity yields empty results
- AND the stats bar MUST NOT show any severity chips

#### Scenario: S45

- GIVEN 10 observations all with `severity: null`
- WHEN the severity filter is set to "Critical"
- THEN 0 observations MUST be displayed
- AND the stats bar MUST show "0 observations"

---
